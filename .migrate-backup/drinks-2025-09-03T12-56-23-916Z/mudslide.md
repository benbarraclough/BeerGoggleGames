### Ingredients ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

1.  Coffee liqueur - 25ml
2.  Vodka - 25ml
3.  Dark Chocolate - 25g
4.  Ice - 1 handful
5.  Irish cream liqueur - 25ml
6.  Double cream - 50ml

### Recipe ![target](/images/rules.webp)

1.  Chill a glass by putting it in the fridge.
2.  Whilst the glass chills, put the chocolate in a shallow bowl and melt in the microwave in short bursts.
3.  Dip the rim of the chilled glass in the melted chocolate, then stand it upright in the fridge so it gradually drips down the sides and cools.
4.  Fill a cocktail shaker with ice, then pour in the coffee liqueur, vodka, Irish cream liqueur and double cream.
5.  Shake until the outside of the shaker is very cold.
6.  Get the glass out and put a few ice cubes in, then strain in the cocktail. Finely grate over the remaining chocolate and serve with a straw.

### Top Tips ![target](/images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Make sure the chocolate has chilled for long enough in the fridge
-   Use a shallow bowl for your chocolate so its easy to dip your glasses into
