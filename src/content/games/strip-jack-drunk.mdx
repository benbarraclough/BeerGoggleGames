<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
Starting with the player who dealt, each player must flip the top card of their hand into the middle without seeing it until flipped. This continues with the next player placing their card on top of the previous players and so on.

The drinking starts when a face card is played by someone, any other card played means nothing. This gives the next player a number of chances (detailed below) to place another face card down.

Jack = 1 chance

Queen = 2 chance

King = 3 chance

Ace = 4 chance

If a player fails to put a face card down within their amount of chances, they must pick up the cards in the middle, add them to the bottom of their pile and drink as many sips as they had in chances.

The game then starts again with the player who picked up the cards playing their top card and moving to the next player. The first one to get rid of all their cards is the winner, gets to choose who the loser is and the forfeit they must do.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/images/rules.webp">
-   The winner may choose any player as the loser but should take the thickness of their hand into account
-   Each player must play 1 card at a time
-   Players must have their cards upside down at all times so they cannot see the cards until theyâ€™re played

<h4>Bonus Rules</h4>

-   Snap: If two matching cards are played after one another, the first player to say snap makes someone of their choosing take a sip
-   Accumulate: Each time a face or an ace is played, make a new pile of cards to continue the game, this counts the amount of faces or aces have been played in that round. At the end of a round when a player loses all of their chances, they must drink for each pile that had been made as well as picking them all up.
-   2s: Every time a 2 is played each player must quickly put down their cards and show both hands, the last person to do this drinks
-   Last Chance Saloon: If a player places a face card on their last chance, they get to dish out 1 sip to the player of their choice
