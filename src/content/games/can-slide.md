-   1 Can of beer/cider

### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Slide the can into the score zones to win the game and avoid the forfeit

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Starting with the team who holds the can, they must slide the can across the table into one of the three zones

Zone 1: If your can lands here, all players on the other team must drink 1 sip of their own drink

Zone 2: If your can lands here, all players on the other team must drink 2 sips of their own drink

Zone 3: If your can lands here, all players on the other team must drink 3 sips of their own drink

Miss: If your can misses all zones but doesn't fall off the edge, your whole team must drink 2 sips of their own drink

Off the edge: If your can throw falls off the edge, you must finish the can and get another whilst the rest of your team takes a sip of their own drink

Play this until you're out of cans

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   No touching the can after it has been thrown until it has stopped still
-   The can must be slid standing up
-   Scoring still counts if the can lands in a zone but has fallen over
-   Zones drawn must be equally sized on both teams

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **1 on 1**

Play a 1 on 1 knockout tournament by using 2 cans each and playing 3 rounds in aim to get the most points. Zone 1 gets you 1 point, zone 2 gets you 2 points and zone 3 gets you 3. The lowest scoring player after the 3 rounds must drink their cans and leave the game, the next game is played by a new contender who will attempt to knock the winner out.
