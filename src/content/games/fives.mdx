<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
To start, everyone must put their fists in the centre if they want to play. The player who organised the game goes first by counting down from 3. At the end of the count down, each player must either make a fist or an open hand and the player whose go it is must guess the amount of fingers shown (0 or a multiple of 5).

If the player guesses correctly, they are out of the game and do not have to do the forfeit. The next player then takes their turn

If the player guesses incorrectly, they stay in the game and the next player must take their turn

This continues until there are is only 1 player left who is the loser. The loser must then finish their drink
