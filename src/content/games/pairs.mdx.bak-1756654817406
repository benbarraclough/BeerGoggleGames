<GameSection title="Setup" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/settings.webp">
Gather 8 pairs of items small enough for each of them to fit under a cup. Cover each item with a cup and shuffle them around the table so nobody knows whats under each of them and then make a 4x4 formation in the centre. Gather all players around the table with full drinks of their own ready to play.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The person who looks most like they would have a twin goes first by selecting two cups from the stack and lifting them up to reveal the objects underneath.

If the objects match then the cups are taken out of the centre and the objects are collected by the player. The player who found the pairs then gets to fill the cups with whatever drink(s) and can dish them out to any player to chug.

If the objects do not match, the cups are to be placed back over them and the player must take a sip of their own drink.

These steps are repeated for each person around the circle until all cups have been paired up and dished out. The player with the most object pairs wins and everyone else must finish their drinks

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   When lifting up cups, make sure that all players see the objects under the cups.
-   Only two cups can be lifted per turn
-   Drinks given as punishments can be anything as long as they don't exceed the cup
-   Each player takes one turn at a time which rotates clockwise

<GameSection title="**Team Play**" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
<p>Pair yourselves up as teams of 2 to play this version of the game which is a little trickier. Players cannot discuss strategy or object locations within their team. Each player within a team must pick a cup on their turn requiring the need for concentration or telepathic teammates.</p>
