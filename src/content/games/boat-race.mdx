To start this race everyone must be in their teams sat down with a drink as mentioned in the setup before somebody counts down from 3 seconds. On "Go" the first player must chug their drink until finished and then put the cup on their head to signal to the next player in the boat to drink.

Once all players have finished their drinks, the whole team must quickly hold their cups on top of their head before any other team to win

If a team finishes before you, each team must finish their drinks and perform a forfeit of the winning teams' choosing
