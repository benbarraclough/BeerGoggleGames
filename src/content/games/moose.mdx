As shown in the picture above, place the ice tray long ways on one end of the table and the solo cup at the furthest end, filled with a drink of choice. Place the coin on the other end of the table which is where all players will stand from and shoot. The ice tray can be taped to the front of the cup as shown but this isn't a requirement and may cause spillages if cup isn't weighed down enough.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Everybody takes turns (usually starting with the person who donated the coin) bouncing the coin onto the table aiming for the ice tray at the other end.

If the coin is bounced into the left hand side of the ice tray, the player who counced the coin may give out drinks to others. The number of drinks given are determined by the number of slots up the tray the coin lands.

If the coin is bounced into the right hand side of the ice tray, the player who bounced the coin must take drinks themselves. The number of drinks taken are determined by the number of slots up the tray the coin lands.

If the coin lands in the solo cup, you must finish and refill the solo cup.

The last slot on each side are the Moose slots. When a player bounces a quarter into one of these slots, everybody must put their hands to their head acting as though they have antlers and then shout "Moose!". The last person to do this drinks the solo cup.

This continues until everyone is good and drunk
