<GameSection title="Setup" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/settings.webp">
Place the deck of cards face-down in the center of a table. Fill the cups and shot glasses with various drinks from beer and cider to cocktails and spirit shots. Once these are filled, space them out evenly around the edge of the table and posiiton each player in front of a drink also evenly spaced. A good rule of thumb is to have at least 2 drinks on the table per player.

Going around the table counter clockwise, the player to the left of the host draws a card first. The instructions for each card follow below:

JACK: Everyone takes a sip from the drink in front of them

QUEEN: Switch with another player's spot and everyone takes a sip from the drink in front of them

KING: Switch two drinks on the table and everyone takes a sip from the drink in front of them

ACE: Take all the drinks and choose who gets to drink what. You can then have people take no sips or multiple sips

JOKER (optional): Everyone gives the person that drew the card their drink. The drawer has to sip ALL drinks given

NUMBER: Move anti-clockwise in front of the next available drink

If a drink is empty, players can choose to remove it or refill it, as the game lasts until all cards have been drawn.
