Set up a slip and slide wide enough that two people can go down simultaneously and as long as you can make it using a piece of tarp with water sprayed over the top. At the bottom of the slip and slide leave a bit of space for the landing zone and then stand a table up with 1 drink per person to drink and flip. Split the players into two teams and get everyone to stand at the top of the slip and slide in an ordered line.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the first player in each team, they must together countdown from 3 before the race starts. Once the countdown ends, each player must slide as fast as they can down the slip and slide to the table so they can drink and flip a cup.

When a player successfully flips their cup, they can shout to their team at the top of the slip and slide which indicates the next player can go.

If the cup is not flipped properly, this must be retried until it has been completed.

This continues for each player until a team has successfully flipped all cups.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   A player cannot go down the slip and slide until the previous player has successfully flipped their cup.
-   The cup must be flipped with 1 hand without interference.
-   A player can only drink and flip 1 cup unless teams have planned to take 2 turns.
