### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Roll your number using the dice 3 times to leave the game and stop drinking.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Each player must choose 1 number on the dice, everybody should have a unique number.

Going round the table, each player must roll the dice in an attempt to roll their number.

If a player rolls their number, they should either note this down on a piece of paper or hold a finger up on their none throwing hand.

If a player rolls a number which is somebody elses, the player whose number it is must take a drink.

The game continues until somebody has rolled their own number three times, then they are out of the game.

The last person left in the game must take a forfeit.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   If a players number is rolled and they are out of the game, the player who rolled the number drinks.
-   The dice must travel clockwise when passing to the next player.
-   If a player is found to have lied about the number of times they rolled their own number, they are reset to 0.
-   If the dice roll on to the floor, this is still a valid roll.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Double dice**

To play the game with more than 6 people, more dice can be added into the game. However, with this change, numbers are more likely to rolled than others and the number 1 is not used. To decide who gets which numbers from 2 - 12, players take turns rolling, whichever number they get first they keep.
