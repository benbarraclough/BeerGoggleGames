<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Everyone playing must begin by counting down from 3 to begin. Once the game starts, only the first player in each team can begin chugging their drink as quick as they can. Once finishing the drinks, they must place the cup the right way up on the edge of the table and flip it so that it lands upside down on the table.

If the flip is made, the game moves onto the next person in the line.

If the flip isn't made, the player must proceed to try and land the flip.

The game finishes when one team has drank and flipped all of their cups successfully.
