### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Penetrate an opponents can by throwing darts at it to make them finish their drink before you.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The game begins by the thrower choosing a players can to aim for and throwing all darts at the target in an attempt to penetrate the can.

If a dart makes contact with a player's can but does not puncture it, that player must take one sip of beer from their own separate, personal drink.

If a dart punctures a player's can, that player must drink beer from the can to at least the hole.

If a dart strikes a player, the thrower must consume their own beer.

If a can is punctured three times, or if a dart enters the mouth of an opened can, that beer must be fully consumed.

Once all darts have been thrown, the player who has had their can shot at can now take their turn.

This continues until there is only 1 player with a can remaining.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Players can use backboards to shield themselves from the darts
-   When a can is penetrated, a minimum of 1 sip is required
-   Cans must be unopened until hit or penetrated
-   Darts must be removed from a can when penetrated to be used again
