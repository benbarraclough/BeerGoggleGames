<p>Roll the dice and hope the number on the dice doesn’t point to a cup that is filled.</p>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
Starting with the tallest player, each player takes their turn to roll the first dice and then after the first number is determined roll the second dice. Whichever number the first dice lands upon points to a specific cup. The second dice then decides how many drinks are required. (E.g. First roll = 5 & Second roll = 2 - This means 2 fingers of drink for cup 5)

If the cup is empty, the player fills the cup with the amount of drink stated on the second dice and then the next player must go.

If the cup is full, the player must drink the amount fingers stated on the second dice and then the next player must go.

This continues around the circle of players for as long as alcohol is available.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/images/rules.webp">
-   If a double is rolled, that player must complete their turn and roll again
-   If a player fills the only empty cup left leaving all cups full at the end of their turn, they get to give out a shot
-   If a player drinks from the last cup with alcohol remaining leaving all cups empty at the end of their turn, they must take a shot
-   If dealing with spirits, use shots instead of fingers as a measurement

<h4>6 Shots</h4>

<p>Replace the cups with shot glasses and only use the one dice for this alternative game. Strictly use shots instead of cups and either fill it to the top or drink from it depending on the number rolled.</p>
