### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Form "electrical currents" by matching cards with other players around the circle to drink as a group or avoid this by not matching cards with others.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

1 by 1 moving clockwise around the circle, each player must flip over and reveal their top card to the group without knowing what it is themselves. Depending on other peoples cards to the left and right of you, this may create a current by making a line of conducting cards (consecutively matching cards)

Conductors: Matching suits, numbers, aces and face cards

If you flip a card that matches the previous players card, you must wait to see if the players after you also match, possibly creating a chain of electricity. When this connection ends, all players involved in the connection must then drink the number on their card.

Sips: 2-10 = The number of sips shown on the card | Aces and Face cards = 10 sips

If you flip over a card that doesn't conduct, you must make sure the players involved in the electrical connection drink the correct amount which is shown by the card iused in that connection.

The game continues in a circle as fast as each player wants, whilst trying to keep everyone focused and drinking the amount of sips they are due. This ends when there are no cards left to flip and can be played again.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   No skipping sips
-   The pace that a player flips their cards is their own choice
-   No hiding cards
-   Conductions can be interlinked as long as the previous card links to the next card in the line **e.g 2 of Hearts, 2 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, 6 of Hearts**

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Reversed**

Instead of players drinking when they make a connection, the player who kills the connection must drink the amount of sips that is on their card. This slows drinking down between the group but ends up making less people drink more, as the original game is too quick for every sip to be taken.
