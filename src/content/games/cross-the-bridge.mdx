<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Split the deck for the highest number to decide who goes first. This player will pick one card from each row and flip it over face up starting from the row closest to them and moving to the next until you reach the other side.

If the player picks up a number, they move on to the next row and flip another card over

If the player picks up a face card or an Ace, they drink the amount of sips equal to the row they're on (the closer you get to the other side, the worse the forfeit). The player must then replace the revealed cards with fresh cards from the deck and pass the turn over to their opponent.

If a player successfully crosses the bridge by not picking up a face or an ace on any rows, the other person must drink 5 sips.

Each round is played 1 at a time until a player successfully crosses the bridge 3 times

<GameSection title="**Royal Decree**" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Additional drinks are consumed when playing this version by assigning cards with an amount of sips, the higher the card the worse the punishment. These sips are added on to the sips required in the original game e.g. A king on row 2 would require 5 sips in total.

**Card assignments:**-   Jack = 1 sip
-   Queen = 2 sips
-   King = 3 sips
-   Ace = 4 sips
