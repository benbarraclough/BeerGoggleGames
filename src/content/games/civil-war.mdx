<GameSection title="Setup" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/settings.webp">
Get together 2 teams of 3 - 5 participants, each player then needs 6 cups or 'soldiers' each and a drink to fill those cups up with. Each team has a side of the table (the bigger the table, the more players can fit), each team should be shoulder to shoulder and have their cups racked in front of them in a triangle filled to the fill line. Balls are then placed in the centre of the table for all to grab, there must be a ball each +20% meaning if there was 8 people, then there would need to be 10 balls.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
When everything is set up, all players must signal they're ready by raising 1 hand in the air. Once every player has their hand in the air, a countdown from 3 commences and the game begins.

Players start by simultaneously grabbing balls in the centre and throwing them into cups, no order is required here.

If a cup is scored into (or a soldier is hit), this soldier is now dead and must be removed from the battlefield by the player who suffered the casualty.

If a shot is missed, this ball can be grabbed and rethrown by the first player to get their hands onto it.

The game continues until only 1 team has soldiers remaining.
