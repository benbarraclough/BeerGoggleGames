All players need to be gathered round the table with drinks filled and ready to play. The dealer must then hand the cards out evenly between the players face down so that there are no cards remaining and that the players cannot see their cards.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
To start, all players must pick up their cards but they must be facing down as they cannot be seen. At the same time all players flip the top card over and place it on the table for everyone to see. If your card is 1 above, the same or 1 below the number of another players card, you may call them a "dick head" by pointing at them and shouting. By doing this, you make them take a sip of their drink and it prevents them calling you a dick head.

If someone rightfully calls you a dick head, they must take one sip before the next card is played.

If you rightfully call another player a dick head, they must take one sip before the next card is played.

If someone unrightfully calls someone a dick head, they must take 2 sips.

A round ends when no more dick heads can be called and then everyone flips over the next card. The game is played everyone runs out of cards.

<p>The player who is the last one holding cards wins: Each time you call somebody a dick head, you can take their card and put it to the bottom of your pile giving you an extra life. You cannot take your own card back, this is left on the table. The player who wins gets to give 1 other player a forfeit.</p>
