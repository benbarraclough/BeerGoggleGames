### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Work your way up to bouncing the ball 7 times across the table to your partner without messing up to complete the game.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

The player holding the ball starts by bouncing the ball to the other player using only one bounce, the player then bounces back with only two bounces.

This continues back and forth until the players reach 7 bounces without messing up.

If a player messes up, they must drink and start again from 1 bounce.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   The only mistake allowed is bouncing the exact amount of times the previous player did (note: this can only be done once per game).
-   Once a player messes up, the game must restart
-   The ball can only be caught when it is bouncing off the table, the ball cannot be caught if it would hit the table again.
-   The ball must be thrown with elbows behind the table.
-   No drinks should be missed.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Obstacles**

Add obstacles on the table if the regular challenge is getting too easy.

-   Cups with drinks in (if the ball enters the cup it must be drank)
-   Pieces of paper with forfeits on or additional rules to the game
-   Other balls
-   Different surfaces that can divert the balls trajectory
