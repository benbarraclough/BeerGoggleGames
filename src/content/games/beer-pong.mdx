Split into 2 teams taking 6 or 10 cups each (based on size of game) and either fill them all halfway with water or booze, whilst positioning them in a triangle formation at the end of the table pointing towards eachother. Fill the remaining solo cup with water as a wash cup, placing it in the centre of the table to the side.

<p>Throw the ball into all of your oppositions cups to win and avoid the forfeit</p>
</GameSection>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
<p>To start, the starting player of each team must play rock paper scissors against their opposition to decide who throws the ball first. From here, each team takes it in turn to shoot from their end of the table to the oppositions cups at the other end.
If the thrower scores the shot, the cup that was scored in is removed from the rack and placed on the side. The team that loses the cup must all take 2 sips of their drink and then proceed by taking their shot.
If the thrower misses the shot, the thrower is shamed and then the next team gets to throw.
This continues until 1 team has lost all cups and must finish the rest of their drinks and/or another drink.</p>

<h4>Hardcore Rules</h4>

-   If you throw the ball and catch the rebound or rollback without it touching the floor, you get a bonus throw
-   If the ball hits any other cup before going within another cup, all cups count and are removed
-   If the ball hits one of your cups and you catch it with one hand, you can take one of the oppositions cups away
-   Combo: If you score your ball in the oppositions cup, you retain possession of the ball until you miss
-   If you throw the ball into a cup on the side that you have already scored in, it is added back to the oppositions rack
-   If the ball bounces when thrown it can be swiped using a hand
-   If you throw and bouncing and score, you can choose another cup to remove
-   If the ball is spinning round the rim, it can be blown out using only air and no touch
