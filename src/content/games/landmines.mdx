<p>Spin the coin, drink a considerable amount of drink and catch the coin without hitting a landmine.</p>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
The beginning player spins the coin on the table and drinks their drink whilst the coin spins. Before the coin stops spinning/falls, the player must sit their drink down and grab the coin with the same hand.

If the coin is spun and caught successfully, the coin is passed to the next peron in the circle.

If the coin spin is screwed up by fumbling, dropping it on the floor or catching with the wrong hand, the player must attempt the spin again.

If the coin spin is screwed up 3 times in a row, a shot is poured for the player to drink as punishment and they must attempt to spin again.

Once a drink is finished it can be then placed on the table in a strategic position to act as a landmine which can prevent successful spins.

The game continues until the table is unplayable, no further drinks are available or the participants can no longer participate.
