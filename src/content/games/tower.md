### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Avoid the tower by not rolling a 6 and not breaking any rules.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The person holding the dice rolls first.

If the dice lands on any number other than 6, no action is taken and the dice moves clockwise around the circle by the amount on the dice (e.g. if a 3 is rolled, the next roller will be the third person after the current roller)

If a 6 is rolled, a coaster or drink is taken from the tower which will need to be drank or completed to move on.

After the tower is finished, the game ends.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   If someone touches the dice who isn't the designated roller at that time, they automatically become the roller.
-   If a drink is not drank or a task is not completed, a seperate forfeit must be done.
-   Shaking or disrupting the stability of the tower is punished by 2 tower removals (1 coaster & 1 drink).
-   If someone disrupts and topples the tower, they lose the game and must drink a whole tower after cleaning up the mess.

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Blind Drinks**

Each player secretly creates a drink for the tower so nobody knows what they're drinking
