The game starts after a countdown of 3, then the first player in each team begins by performing step 1.

Step 1: The first player in each team must then supply drinks down the line to their teammates via their mouth.

Step 2: One after the next, each player in each team must take it in turns to finish their drink using only their mouths.

Step 3: After each player has finished their drink they must place the empty cup of theirs onto the table upside down.

The first team to have all cups on the table flipped upside down and empty wins.
