Starting with the player who owns the coins, one by one each player must place a coin on top of the piece of card.

If the card stands and doesn't touch the table, the game continues.

If the coin falls, you must take a sip and replace the coin

If the card collapses and all of the coins rested on it fall. You lose

Keep playing until the weight of the coins is too much for the card and it falls.
