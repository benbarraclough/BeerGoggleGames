Get all participating players in a circle with drinks filled and the deck of cards flipped upside down where they can be reached (the more players involved the better). Preferably position players next to those that they are comfortable going mouth to mouth with and you're ready to play.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the player with the biggest mouth, they must take a card from the top of the deck and suck it so that it sticks to their mouth without anything else other than suction.

They must then pass this card to the next player clockwise around the circle, again only by the use of suction and no other means.

If you successfully pass the card to the next player without breaking any rules, you are safe and can wait until the card comes back round.

If you break a rule whilst passing the card or drop the card, you must take a sip of your drink and start again

Suck and blow until you're all out of puff!

-   No tilting of the head to balance the card rather than suck
-   No holding the card by any other means other than mouth suction
-   If a card is dropped and there is no 1 clear person responsible, all involved must drink

<p>Each card being played with has a forfeit assigned to it if dropped. Some cards may be better or worse than others so make sure you know which card is currently in play. Everytime a card is dropped or the round has ended, a new card is picked from the deck to start the next round.</p>
