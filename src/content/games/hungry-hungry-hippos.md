### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Score and claim the highest amount of solo cups out of the group to win

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

After the group counts down from 3 the game starts, each player simultaneously attempts to bounce their ping pong ball into one of the cups in the centre.

When a player scores a cup, they must immediately grab the cup and drink it before they can continue shooting again.

When a player misses, they must retrieve their ball as best as they can to continue shooting

The game ends when all cups in the centre have been claimed and drank. The winner is the player with the most cups and can then issue a forfeit to each loser.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   Shots must be bounced at least once to count
-   Interferance with other players balls is advised
-   A player must drink their claimed cups before they can shoot again
-   No touching or moving the centre cups unless scored within or to retrieve a ball
-   If two people score the same cup at the same time, the first one to grab it gets it

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Bonus Rules**

-   Place decoy cups in the centre that contain water and do not count towards a players score
-   If a shot bounces off a cups rim and another player catches it, that player can claim the cup.
-   Other players balls can be swatted
-   Shots do not have to bounce and can be thrown straight into cups
