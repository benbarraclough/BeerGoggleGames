### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Bounce the tray into as many empty ice tray spaces as possible.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Starting with the player with the coin, one at a time, each player takes it in turns to bounce the coin on the table in an attempt to land it in a space within the ice tray (similar to the game quarters).

If the player lands it in an empty ice tray space, they must fill it up with their drink of choice

If the player misses, nothing happens.

If the player lands it in an ice tray space that has been filled already. The player who bounced it must drink the liquid with a straw to retrieve the coin and takes another turn.

After each players turn, the coin is passed to the next player in the circle. This game continues until all players are sufficiently drunk.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   The coin must remain in the ice tray space to count
-   The coin must bounce, it can’t be thrown straight into a tray space
-   Whoever bounces the coin into an empty tray space chooses the drink that it is filled with

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Mayhem**

A rapid fire game of bouncing, filling and drinking. Multiple coins for multiple players all playing simultaneously with a communal drink that is used to fill up. Once the drink is finished, play stops.
