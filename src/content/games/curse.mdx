<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The cursed one begins the game by grabbing the cards, setting the timer off for an unknown amount of time and setting it down in the centre so it can’t be seen but can be reached.

The cursed player then must shout a number out loud that will be used to release them from the curse (E.g. “Release me number 2”). Once stated, the player flips cards over 1 by 1 as fast as they wish from the face down deck.

If the number stated is found, the player is released from the curse and can pass it to any other player along with the card deck. The curse can also be removed by tricking another player into obtaining the curse using the rules of the game against them.

The player who is cursed when the timer ends is the loser and takes the shot.

The round can be restarted by the loser refilling the shot glass, shuffling the cards and setting the timer off again.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   If you look in the eyes of the player who is cursed, the curse is transferred to you.
-   If you touch any of the cards, the curse is transferred to you.
-   If you touch the timer before it ends, the curse is transferred to you.
-   If the timer is still going and the pack has finished, collect the cards and carry on flipping.
-   To find your number, only one card can be turned over at a time.
-   If you answer a question asked by the cursed one, the curse is transferred to you.
