### Equipment ![target](images/liquor.webp)

-   1 solo cup
-   2 shot glasses
-   2 double-shot glasses
-   2 coins

### Setup ![target](images/settings.webp)

Place the solo cup in the very middle followed by the double-shot glasses either side, and finally the shot glasses so that there is a sort of pyramid structure in a line. Fill them all up with beer and ensure they are all set 4 fingers apart. The two players participating then sit across from each other holding their coins, aligning themselves with the row of glasses ready to play.

### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Shoot your coin into the drinks containers going from smallest to largest, racing to make it into all three in a row to win.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The game begins on the count of three where both players attempt to throw their coin into the shot glass.

When a shot is scored, the drink must be drank by the thrower and the throwing continues.

When a shot is missed, the coin should be grabbed again as quickly as possible to take another shot.

When a shot is scored in a glass out of order (bigger than the smallest available) then it must be drank by the shooter and refilled.

The game continues until a player completes the set of three shots and ends the game by scoring in the solo cup. The losing player must then chug the entire solo cup full of beer.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Shots can be bounced or thrown straight in.
-   Drinks that have been consumed should be set aside.
-   If you swallow the coin, game over, you lose.
-   The throwing distance must be the same for each player.
