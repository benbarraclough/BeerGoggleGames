### Equipment ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   A drink each

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Gather a group of people with filled drinks where everyone can hear eachother, the more the better. A circle is not required as this game is purely based on sound but its good if you want to see everybody participating.

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Collectively count to 21 without interrupting each other by saying the same number.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

The player introducing the game starts the game by saying the first number which is "1". This is followed by someone saying "2" and so on in no particular order until a player reaches 21.

If you say the correct number without clashing with another player who speaks, the group continues the count

If you say the wrong number, clash with another player speaking at the same time, you must drink and start from the beginning again.

Play for as long as possible where you can either start a fresh round or develop the game using the special edition below.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   No hesitations
-   No whispers
-   No signalling
-   If a player doesn't get involved, the group can issue 2 sips as retribution

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Lives**

Mark everyones cup using a pen with two lines equally measured between the bottom and the top of the drink (if using a pen isn't possible, just imagine your drink is split into thirds). Each time you clash, break a rule or mess up you must drink a third of your drink and essentially a life of yours. Each time the group hits 21, they gain a life back and can top a third of their drink up if possible which could mean people rejoin the game after losing all of their lives. Play on until there are only 2 players remaining in the game, who can then designate a loser to drink the rest of their cup.
