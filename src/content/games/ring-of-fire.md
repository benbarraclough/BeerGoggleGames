### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Try not to lose the game by not picking the last king or breaking the ring of fire.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

To start, each player must surround the ring of fire and take their turn one at a time to choose a card from the ring. Each card corersponds to a certain task or rule which must be completed.

The next player can go when the previous player completes the task given to them by their card. If the ring of fire is broken, the breaker must be punished and downs their drink. The ring is re-formed and the play goes on.

When a king is drawn, a small amount of alcohol needs to be added to the centre cup by the drawer. Whoever picks up the last king must add their drink to the centre cup and chug it all to end the game.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Each king must add drink to the centre cup and take a shot for extra fun
