<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
On the count of 3, the batter begins the game by carrying out these 5 steps:

1\. Crack and chug a full can of alcohol.

2\. Pass the empty can to the thrower.

3\. Grab the bat, put one end to the floor and the other to your forehead before running around it 10 times.

4\. Stand on the batting zone straight away, face the thrower and prepare to hit the can.

5\. Hit the can as far as possible when the thrower pitches the can.

Each participant takes their turn to see who can hit the can the furthest. Measure the distance once everyone has been and crown the winner.

-   The batter is only allowed 3 seconds to recover between when they finished spinning and when the can is thrown.
-   No re-throws, 1 throw per empty can (unless the thrower misthrows).

<h4>Homerun</h4>

Mark out a safe base 10-15 yards away from the batting zone. The batter must attempt to run through the same steps as the regular game but also make it to the safe baseafter the can is thrown. All players who make it to the home base move to the next round until there is only 1 winner.

-   You must have at least 3 players allowing the use of fielders.
-   To stop the batter from reaching base, the fielders and thrower can either catch the can or touch the batter with the can.
-   A new can is drank per round.
