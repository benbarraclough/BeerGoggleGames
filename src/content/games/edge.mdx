<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
All players side by side roll their dice at the same time down to the end of the table in attempt to get as close to the edge.

Whichever player gets their die closest to the end of the table is the winner and gets to dish out the amount of sips designated on the die to other players, (e.g. 5 on the dice is 5 sips, divided however you like)

The players who land their dice on the table but don't get closest to the edge have no forfeit.

Any player who rolls their die off of the table surface must drink 3 sips.

This continues until one person wins 3 times.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   All players should roll from the same point.
-   No roll interference is allowed.
-   If multiple dice are equally close to the edge, there should be a vote as to who is closest. Alternatively, those players take a reroll.

<p>Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:</p>

<h4>Ordered rolling</h4>

<p>Rather than all players rolling at once, players take it in turns to roll. The order is decided at the start of each round by rolling dice to begin with to see who gets the highest number, the player with the highest number gets to choose the order.</p>
