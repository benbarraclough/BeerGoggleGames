### Equipment ![target](images/liquor.webp)

-   Solo Cups
-   Pong Balls
-   A drink each

### Setup ![target](images/settings.webp)

Get together 2 teams of 3 - 5 participants, each player then needs 6 cups or 'soldiers' each and a drink to fill those cups up with. Each team has a side of the table (the bigger the table, the more players can fit), each team should be shoulder to shoulder and have their cups racked in front of them in a triangle filled to the fill line. Balls are then placed in the centre of the table for all to grab, there must be a ball each +20% meaning if there was 8 people, then there would need to be 10 balls.

### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Knock out the other team by shooting balls into all of their cups.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

When everything is set up, all players must signal they're ready by raising 1 hand in the air. Once every player has their hand in the air, a countdown from 3 commences and the game begins.

Players start by simultaneously grabbing balls in the centre and throwing them into cups, no order is required here.

If a cup is scored into (or a soldier is hit), this soldier is now dead and must be removed from the battlefield by the player who suffered the casualty.

If a shot is missed, this ball can be grabbed and rethrown by the first player to get their hands onto it.

The game continues until only 1 team has soldiers remaining.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Cups must be removed when they have been shot into, if there is a dead cup still in the rack of a player, any shot of theirs is void.
-   Friendly fire is allowed.
-   Blocking is not allowed unless the ball bounces.
-   Any player can shoot at any time in any cup during the game.
-   Each player must only shoot from behind their rack of cups.
-   A shooters elbows must be behind the edge of the table.
