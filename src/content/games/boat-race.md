### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Work as a team to finish your drinks before the opposing team(s)

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

To start this race everyone must be in their teams sat down with a drink as mentioned in the setup before somebody counts down from 3 seconds. On "Go" the first player must chug their drink until finished and then put the cup on their head to signal to the next player in the boat to drink.

Once all players have finished their drinks, the whole team must quickly hold their cups on top of their head before any other team to win

If a team finishes before you, each team must finish their drinks and perform a forfeit of the winning teams' choosing

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   To finish, each team must have their cup on their head
-   All drinks must be equal amounts
-   You can't drink until the previous player finishes their drink
-   Shouting and making as much noise as possible is imperitive

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Big Jugs**

Instead of having a cup for each player, there will only be one big jug per team. The team must each drink a portion of their jug and pass it to the player behind them. Which is finished by the player at the back of the boat
