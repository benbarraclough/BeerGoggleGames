### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Don't blow the last card off the top of the drink to avoid the forfeit

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

As a group nominate a player to go first. This player must start by blowing the cards that are resting on the top of the drink as gently as possible in attempt to knock a card off the top of the deck.

If the player manages to blow one or more cards off the top of the deck without blowing the last card, the players' turn is over and the next player in the group must take their turn.

If the player blows the last card off top of the drink, they lose and must finish the centre drink.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   No touching the cards unless they are on the table
-   If you are next in line to blow, you must blow
-   Each player must blow at least 1 card off the top of drink to complete their turn
-   No deck disruptions

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Tarot Cards**

Assign a selection of cards with a prophecy which can be a rule, task or forfeit. If you blow that card off the top and it shows, then it must be completed.

**Examples:**-   Ace - Everybody drinks
-   8 - Blow again
-   2 - Reverse the order of who goes next
-   King - Exemption from the game. Skip next go
