<p>Light your candle to drink your drink and finish it before your opponent to win.</p>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
On the countdown, the game begins by each player simultaneously attempting to light their own candle with their lighter or matches. As soon as the player lights their candle they can drink their drink

Once both players have their candle lit, either one of them can blow the others candle out which prevents them from drinking any further. The player who had their candle blown out must then relight their candle to continue the game.

As soon as one player finishes their drink, they win.

The loser of the game finishes their drink and refills their drink to finish as a punishment.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/images/rules.webp">
