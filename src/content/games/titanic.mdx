<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the player who has the biggest hands, everyone around the circle must take it in turns to pour a spirit of choice from the bottle into the shot glass whilst it floats in the cup.

If you successfully pour the alcohol into the shot glass, pass the bottle to the next player.

If a player sinks the shot glass whilst pouring the alcohol into it, they must finish the whole drink.

This is played until the shot glass (Titanic) is sunk and can be replayed pretty quickly and easily.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   Wait three seconds after pouring the shot before passing to the next player
-   The bottle should always be passed clockwise
-   A player may pour as much as they wish into the shot glass
-   The cup or shot glass may not be touched or disrupted at any time

<h4>Drip shot</h4>

If you don't have a container of any sort to act as your titanic, play this alternative game with the same principles.

Fill a centre glass three quarters full with water and fill another half full. one by one each player must use the half full glass to drip water into the other glass until it overflows. Just don't be the player who makes it overflow, otherwise you forfeit.
