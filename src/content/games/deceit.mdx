<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Choose one player to start as the oracle, this person must fill 1 shot with the clear alcohol and the rest with water before shuffling them around so none of the other players know which is which.

Once all shots are shuffled, each player except the oracle must pick a shot for themselves and take it in turns to drink them 1 by 1 going round the group, so that everyone can be viewed when drinking.

Each player drinking must then write on their piece of paper the player that they think had the shot containing alcohol. The player who drank the alcoholic shot then reveals themself and is confirmed by the oracle. Each player then reveals if they guessed correctly or incorrectly.

For each player that guesses correctly, the player who drank the shot must take 2 sips of their own drink.

Each player who guesses incorrectly must take 2 sips of their own drink

If no players guess the correct drinker, everyone but the drinker must take a shot.

If all players guess the correct drinker, the drinker must take a shot.

In the next round, the oracle status switches to the player who drank the shot and the above game is repeated. The game continues until the spirits are depleted.

<h4>Free for all</h4>

<p>This edition removes the need for an oracle but creates a large amount deceit and uncertainty. Add a further shot glass to the mix so there are as many as players in the game. This time every player must take a shot in every round which means the only way that the loser is decided upon is based on votes. Whoever receieves the most votes on paper in that round must take a shot and the real shot taker does not have to reveal themselves.</p>
