### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Knock other players nails into the stump to make them drink.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

The player with the hammer must throw the hammer up into the air making it do a 360 degree spin, catch it and hit another players nail into the the stump

If a players nail is knocked straight into the stump entirely, they must take 3 sips of their drink and place another nail into the stump for themself.

If a players nail is only slightly knocked into the stump, that player must take only 1 sip of their drink

If a player knocks a nail sideways so that it bends, this nail must be fixed

If a player misses a nail entirely

If sparks fly, everyone must take a sip

If the hammer is dropped, the dropper must take a sip

Each player takes only 1 turn to do this each time they have the hammer. After a players attempt, they must pass to the next player around the circle.

The game continues until somebody gets injured or players have run out of drink/nails.

-   A hammer spin and hit must be done quickly in one clean motion
-   If you knock your own nail in by accident, double the amount of drinks required
-   A player must always have a nail stuck in the stump assigned to them
-   A nail is knocked in entirely when the head of the nail touches the wood

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

-   If a player loses all 3 lives, they are out of the game
-   Each player gets 3 nails each which count as a life each
-   The winner of the game can issue another player with a forfeit
