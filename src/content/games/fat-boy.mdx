Starting with the game organiser, each person must count in order around the circle from 1 upwards. However, if the number contains a 7 or is a multiple of 7, you must replace it with "Fat boy".

Counting proceeds as follows (1-6 "FatBoy" 8-13 "FatBoy" 15-16 "FatBoy"...)

If a player fails to keep within the rules by saying the wrong number, messing up the count or not saying "Fatboy" on their turn, they must take a generous sip.

Each time there is a failure, the count starts again from the person who gets it wrong.

<h4>Bonus Rules</h4>

Adding further rules into the game makes it more exciting and harder to play, which means more drinking

-   Every multiple of 9 must be replaced (e.g. name of an unhealthy food)
-   Skip every twin number (e.g. 11,22,33)
-   Knockout: If you get it wrong you're out of the game, the last one standing wins
-   Everytime you say FatBoy, it gets louder
-   Every multiple of 10 everyone must take a sip
