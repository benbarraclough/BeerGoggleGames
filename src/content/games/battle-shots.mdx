<GameSection title="Equipment" icon="/images/liquor.webp">
-   16-20 shot glasses
-   Spirits of choice
-   2 Pizza boxes/Cardboard
-   2 pens
</GameSection>

<GameSection title="Setup" icon="/images/settings.webp">
Divide the shot glasses between 2 teams and construct your side of the board using a pizza box (or multiple pieces of cardboard) and a pen to draw both the opponents 6x6 grid and your 6x6 grid. Then place all of your shots on a grid square of your choosing marked with an "S" so they can't be changed. Follow this short [setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlVWspeDEgw) by [tipsy elves](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLIzW8i9xH6vhyPdYuWyfNQ) for assistance.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
Very similar to Battleships, you must guess the locations of your opponents shots turn by turn and mark where each guess has been taken on your grids. If played within a team, only 1 player can go each time the team gets a guess.

If a guess hits a shot, the team whose shot is hit must decide who chug it between them. The shot must be drank before they can take their next guess.

If a guess misses, the person who missed must take a sip of their own drink.

Once all of the shots have been drank by the loser, the losing team must also drink the remaining shots from the other teams' board.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/images/rules.webp">
-   Peaking is disciplined by having one of your shots taken away
-   Reverse psychology and insults are encouraged
-   No takebacks (once you said it, consider it guessed)
-   Mark the spots where you place your shots with an "S" so theres no cheating

<h4>COMBO guesses</h4>

Whenever a team guesses correctly they start a combo and get another guess. The turn to guess only switches once a player misses their guess.

**Additional alternatives:**-   Military rankings: Choose one player on your team to be the commander. only the commander can guess. If anyone else guesses, the whole team must drink
-   Quickfire: Everytime you miss a guess, you take a shot from your own rack
