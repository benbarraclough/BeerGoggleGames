<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Everyone must roll for the highest number to decide who goes first. The starting player must then take a roll of the dice to begin the game. If the player rolls a 6 they must take the next step in the game. If not, the dice is passed clockwise around the circle to the next person.

Stage 1: Select the drink(s) that will be poured into the chug cup (e.g All beer, Vodka Lemonade or something a little nastier)

Stage 2: Pour the selected drinks into the chug cup (decide the ratio of each drink if there are multiple).

Stage 3: Drink the centre chug cup

Be careful of your choices in case the chances are not in your favour and you throw all three 6's. Play this until you're out of alcohol.
