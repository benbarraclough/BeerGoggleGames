### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Finish your drinks before the other team to win the game and avoid the forfeit

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

To decide who starts with the balls, the captain of each team must play rock, paper, scissors. To start the game, selected players must throw all balls at once from behind their line in attempt to knock the bottles over.

If your team knock over the bottles in the centre, you can chug from your drinks until the other team stands them back upright again and gets back behind their line. Once the bottles are reset, the other team get a chance to throw.

If your team misses the bottles, nobody can drink and the balls go to the other team to throw.

If the other team knocks over a bottle(s), any member of your team must run as quickly as possible to stand the bottle back up again and get back behind their teams line to stop the other team from drinking.

The game continues until all players in one team finishes their drinks. The losing team must finish the rest of their drink and fill another up to finish as well.
