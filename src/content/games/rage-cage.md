### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Bounce the ball into the cup as quickly as possible before the player behind you to prevent being stacked.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

On the count of 3, both starting players begin by grabbing a cup from the centre, chugging it and bouncing the ball into the empty cup they have.

If the player makes the shot, the ball and cup are passed to the next person.

If the player misses, they must retry until they makes the shot.

This continues until one cup catches up to the other and a player cannot pass to the next player as they have made the shot before the person in front of them.

At this point, instead of passing the cup on, the player stacks the cup in front of them, this is passed onto the next person and the loser who got stacked must grab a cup from the centre, chug it and continue trying to bounce the ball in the cup.

This continues until all centre cups are gone and the final full cup is drank by the ultimate loser

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   Cups must move clockwise
-   If a player makes the shot on the first try, they can pass the cup to anybody on the table
-   If a cup accidentally falls into a centre cup with alcohol in, the player must drink it and then continue the game
-   No moving the cup to catch the ball

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Multi-balls**

If there are a high number of players involved or you just want to increase the intensity of the game, try incorporating more pong balls into the game. More balls means more stacking, and more stacking means more dirnking.
