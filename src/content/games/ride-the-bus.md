### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Round 1: Guess correctly to dish out punishments to other players

Round 2: Get rid of all your cards

Round 3: Guess all consecutive questions correctly to get off the bus

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Round 1

The dealer begins to their left by asking everyone the following questions 1 by 1 whilst dealing them cards. If they answer correct, the individual distributes a drink to another player. If incorrect, the player takes a drink.

Card 1: Dealer asks whether the first card is - "Red or Black?".

Card 2: Dealer asks whether the second card will be - "Higher or Lower" than the first card.

Card 3: Dealer asks whether the third card will be - "Inbetween or Outside" the ranks of the first and second card.

Card 4: Dealer asks - "Which suit?" the fourth card will be. Correct guesses will reward that individual with 5 drinks to distribute. Incorrect guesses are still penalised with one drink.

Round 2

Players collect their four distributed cards and the dealer creates a FACE DOWN pyramid of cards starting with 5 cards at the base, then 4, 3, 2, 1. Drink values are assigned to each horizontal row, the higher up the pyramid means the more drinks.

Starting at the bottom row, a card is flipped one at a time. Any player with a matching card in their hand lays their card down on the pyramid and distributes the row's assigned number of drinks to whomever they choose. Play continues all the way up the tower, with each player attempting to get rid of as many cards as they can.

Round 3

Once the final card on top of the pyramid is handled accordingly, the player with the highest number accumulated over their cards is the loser and must Ride the Bus!

The player who is riding the bus must complete all four questions IN A ROW. Each incorrect guess is penalised with a drink.

1\. Red or Black | 2. Higher or lower | 3. In between or outside | 4. Which Suit.

Any incorrect guess requires the player to start back at question one. The only way the player can finish the game is by answering all questions or getting through the entire deck of cards

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Ace is high
-   Multiple cards can be laid down on the pyramid
-   Players do have the option of saving their cards in hopes of getting a matching card higher up the pyramid
-   Only 1 player can ride the bus, use a tie breaker to decide if required

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Shorten your game by playing:

#### **Pyramid**

Skip round 1 by handing out 5 cards to each player and creating the face down pyramid to start round 2. When riding the bike, instead of asking the four questions from the above game, the player just needs guess the correct colour of the cards three times in a row.

-   Bottom row - 2 sips
-   4 card row - 3 sips
-   3 card row - 4 sips
-   2 card row - 5 sips
-   Top row - 1 shot
