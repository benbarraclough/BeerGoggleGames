### Equipment ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   4 cans or more per team
-   A long hallway
-   String

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Mark the scoring zones at one end of the hallway by forming 3 circles with the string as big as possible, 1 smaller than the next within eachother similar to a curling score zone. Assign each team with a captain and each player with a can or two each whilst everyone stands at the other end of the hall ready to begin.

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Score points for your team by sliding cans within the scoring zones to beat the other team and win.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

To decide who goes first, captains of each time must play rock paper scissors. The winner then chooses the order.

To begin, each player from the starting team takes their turn one at a time to slide their cans across the floor in attempt to land it in the scoring zones.

Outer zone = 1 point

Middle zone = 2 points

Inner zone = 3 points

Once everyone from a team has slid all of their cans, the points are then counted as they lie and removed for the next team to take their turn.

After each team has taken their turn and counted their points for that round. The team with the least points must drink their cans and get new ones to play the next round.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   A throw is void if the player throws it when over the throw line
-   Points are counted at the end of each round and not where it originally lands (avoid knocking your teammates cans out)
-   Cans can be rebounded off of other cans or obstacles o gain points
-   If a can bursts open, the can becomes void and cannot earn points
-   Cans can only be picked up when all players in the team have taken their shot

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Alternatives**

-   Outdoor: Play on the grass or pavement
-   Table: Mark the zones on a table with non-permanent marker pen and slide cans across a long table instead
-   Knockout: Make a large score zone where it is a free for all. All players shoot their shots and cans arent removed until everyone has finished (meaning that players can intentionally knock other players cans out).
