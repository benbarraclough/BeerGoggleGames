<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
On the countdown of 3, the first player in each team must race to drink their ice tray of alcohol with their straw.

Once a player consumes their entire ice tray, they must flip their tray over and then the next player in the team can take their turn

If a player spills alcohol from their tray, it must be refilled before drinking any more

The first team to drink all alcohol from their trays and have them flipped over wins the race
