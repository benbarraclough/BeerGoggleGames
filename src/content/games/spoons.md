-   A drink each
-   Spoons

### Setup ![target](images/settings.webp)

Gather all players around a table with filled drinks and deal everybody with 4 cards, the rest of the deck must then be close to the dealer. Place 1 less spoon than there are players playing the game in the middle of the table, an even distance away from everyone so that they can grab one when needed.

### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Match 4 of the same cards in order to grab a spoon. Just make sure you have a spoon at the end of each round

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Players should keep there cards close to them and not reveal them whilst the dealer begins by picking up a card from the top of the deck and passing it around the circle to the next player and then getting another and so on until all players are picking up a card passed to them and passing another card on.

Once a player has 4 of the same card (e.g. 4 Aces) then they can grab a spoon from the centre. As soon as one person grabs a spoon, everyone else can grab one.

The 1 player without a spoon is knocked out (of the game, NOT physically assaulted) and must take as many sips as there are spoons left in the game.

The next person around the circle then becomes the dealer for the next round and deals 4 cards to everyone still in the game whilst placing 1 less spoons in the centre to play the next round. This continues until there is only 1 player in the game.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Pass cards face down
-   Cards must be passed to the next player
-   The last player in the circle makes a bin pile out of their unwanted cards instead of passing them to the dealer again.
-   No faking or false sets
-   No touching spoons until someone has a full set
-   Piles can be made for people who are slow at picking up
-   A player can’t have more than 5 cards in your hand at a time (pick one up, pass one on)
-   If no sets are made, use the bin pile to start the round again

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Backyard Rules**

Play these extremely raw rules to make the game a bit wilder, employing some pretty brutal changes

-   Everyone grabs cards from 1 big pile in the centre and puts back into the centre
-   Cards can be grabbed from other players hands if not guarded
-   If you get a pair, it can be placed in a 'burn pile' to make everyone else take a sip of their drink
-   Spoons can be stolen from others when grabbed
-   Each player who gets knocked out must take a shot
