<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The first person who can think of a scenario goes first by announcing their "Never Have I Ever..." statement to the whole group.

Example Statement: "Never have I ever eaten a strangers leftovers"

If you haven't ever done or been in the stated scenario, no action is required.

If you have ever done or been in the stated scenario, you must take a sip to reveal that you have.

The next person around the circle must then take their turn. This game lasts as long as everyones imagination.
