Spread the cards across the table face down and ask everyone to pick one card. Each player flips their card, the person with the lowest number is the dealer (if multiple players have the lowest card, cards are picked again by just those players).

The dealer then takes the cards and shuffles once more before placing the cards on the table face down. Play then starts from the player to the dealer's left, participating in 3 rounds of guessing before it moves onto the next player clockwise.

Round 1 - The player begins by saying the number of a card they believe is on top of the deck. The dealer then checks the card without showing anyone else.

If guessed correctly, the dealer takes 4 sips and moves to the next player starting from round 1 again.

If guessed incorrectly, play moves onto round 2.

Round 2 - The dealer keeps the card to themselves and states whether the number on the card is lower or higher than the guess in round 1. The player then guesses the number on the card again.

If guessed correctly, the dealer takes 2 sips and moves to the next player starting from round 1 again.

If guessed incorrectly, play moves onto round 3.

Round 3 - The dealer keeps the card to themselves and states whether the number on the card is lower or higher than the guess in round 2. The player then has one last chance to guess but must also state the suit as well to beat the dealer.

If guessed correctly, the dealer takes 1 sip and moves to the next player starting from round 1 again.

If guessed incorrectly, the guesser takes two sips.

If the dealer is not beaten (cards aren't guessed successfully) by 3 players in a row, the dealer may give up their responsibility and pass the cards to another particpant who then becomes the new dealer.

<p>Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:</p>

<h4>Quick fire</h4>

<p>The game is cut down to two rounds missing out round 3, the only other change is if the player guesses incorrectly in round 2, they must drink the amount of sips difference between the guess and the actual card (e.g. player guesses 5 and the card is 7, the player drinks 2)</p>
