<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the roller, everyone takes it in turn to roll the two dice. Based on what is rolled, two actions can occur.

If a player rolls either a 7, 11 or a double then they get to pick another player to put in the hot seat and become The Drinker.

If a player is placed in the hot seat, they must choose what to fill the centre chug cup with before drinking it. From the moment The Drinker touches the filled drink to the moment they put it down empty, The Roller must keep rolling the dice over and over again in attempt to get a 7, 11 or a double. If The Roller gets another 7, 11 or double then the glass is refilled and The Drinker needs to start chugging all over again. If The Roller does not roll another 7, 11 or doubles while The Drinker is chugging then the turn is over.

Once the drinking is over, The Roller refills the glass and the dice are handed to the player on the left of the player. This player is now the new Roller.

-   The drink is always filled by the designated Roller at the time that the cup is empty
