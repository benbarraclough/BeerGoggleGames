### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Flip the cups as fast as you can so neither you or your team get knocked out of the competition

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Start the game by counting down from 3 and then play can begin by each player drinking and flipping a cup at a time the same as regular flip cup, but each player has multiple cups.

Once a team or individual if playing alone drinks and flips all cups before any other team, they stay in the competition.

If a team or individual is the last to finish, they are knocked out of the competition.

This continues knocking 1 person or team out each round until there is only 1 left who is crowned the winner.

Losers take a shot
