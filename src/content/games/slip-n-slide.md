### Equipment ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   Slip and slide or tarp
-   Solo cups
-   Alcohol of choice
-   Long patch of grass
-   Table

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Set up a slip and slide wide enough that two people can go down simultaneously and as long as you can make it using a piece of tarp with water sprayed over the top. At the bottom of the slip and slide leave a bit of space for the landing zone and then stand a table up with 1 drink per person to drink and flip. Split the players into two teams and get everyone to stand at the top of the slip and slide in an ordered line.

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Be the quickest team to slip, slide, drink and flip all cups, winning the game.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Starting with the first player in each team, they must together countdown from 3 before the race starts. Once the countdown ends, each player must slide as fast as they can down the slip and slide to the table so they can drink and flip a cup.

When a player successfully flips their cup, they can shout to their team at the top of the slip and slide which indicates the next player can go.

If the cup is not flipped properly, this must be retried until it has been completed.

This continues for each player until a team has successfully flipped all cups.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   A player cannot go down the slip and slide until the previous player has successfully flipped their cup.
-   The cup must be flipped with 1 hand without interference.
-   A player can only drink and flip 1 cup unless teams have planned to take 2 turns.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

#### **New and improved**

An improved version of the game using more intense rules and equipment.

-   Use a ramp and a pool at the end of the slip and slide to make the landing zone extra special.
-   Fill the slip and slide with inflatables.
-   Make the slip and slide more complex, adding turns and different sections.
-   A teammate from each team must toss a can to the player whilst they slide down the slip and slide which is used to fill the cup before it is drank and flipped.
