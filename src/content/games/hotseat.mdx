<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the person who last touched the bottle of alcohol, one person begins in the hot seat and the others act as the jury. The person in the hot seat starts by providing information that is valuable enough to the group so that they are satisfied.

This information can be a secret, fact, opinion etc. If the person on the hot seat can't think of anything, they can request a question or prompt from the jury.

Once the information is given, the jury has 10 seconds to decide whether they are satisfied by giving either a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

If the amount of thumbs up is majority, the information provided is sufficient and the next person in the circle

If no decision is met, the game proceeds with the next person.

If the person in the hot seat fails to provide information or the amount of thumbs down is majority, they must drink and refill the shot.

The game continues clockwise around the circle until the momentum slows down and nobody wants to play anymore.
