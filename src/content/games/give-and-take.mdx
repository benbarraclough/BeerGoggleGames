<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Gameplay starts by flipping a single card from either the give or take lines in alternating fashion. Each time a card is flipped, the players check their own and eachothers hands for card matches where the number/rank is the same.

If a card flipped over in the give row matches a card in a players hand, they must give either a drink, truth or dare to a player of choice.

If a card flipped over in the take row matches a card in a players hand, they must choose to have either a drink, truth or dare (dares and truths are decided on by thr group)

If a card flipped over does not match any card in a players hand, no action is required

If the option of a drink is chosen by a player, the amount of fingers of drink is based on the row that the card was flipped on. E.g. If it was the 6th card, it will be 6 fingers. This continues until all 6 cards on both rows have been flipped over.

<h4>Extra rules</h4>

Add one, none or all of these in to spice things up

-   Reverse: If a player has two cards in their hand which match one in the take line, this is then reversed and can then be given rather than taken.
-   Totalled: Each card matched is removed from a players hand, the player with the highest score at the end of the game accumulated by the numbers on their cards takes a shot
-   Knockout: Keep your cards until you lose them all. After each round, cards are shuffled and lines are refreshed but not the ones that havent been matched yet. If you still have cards left, you must carry them over to the next round and are not to be dealt any more. The game proceeds until there is only one player still in the game, this is the loser and they must perform a forfeit decided by the rest of the group.
