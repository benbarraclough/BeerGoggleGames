### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Don't topple the tower or else you face the hard alcohol bottle

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Starting with the most tower-like person in the group, they must take a jenga brick from the tower and perform the task without toppling the tower. If the player refuses the task, they must pick two more and complete those instead.

Once a task is complete, the next player clockwise around the group must take their turn

If a player makes the tower fall, they must take as many sips as the group decides from the hard alcohol bottle and restack the tower.

Play on until you're sick of pulling bricks.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   No stabilising th tower when taking the brick
-   No disrupting the tower when its not your turn
-   No peaking at the task and choosing the task you like

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Re-construction**

Take 3 bricks from the tower before starting the game and place them next to the original tower together side by side, this will be the foundation of the new tower. Each brick taken off of the original tower will need to be placed onto the new tower, they can be placed in any which way the player wishes, as long as it doesn't touch the ground/table. If this tower falls they must also drink from the hard alcohol bottle.
