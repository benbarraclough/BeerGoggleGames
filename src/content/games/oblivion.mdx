The instigator of the game must find a player willing to compete with them. Each player must then take 3 cups, fill one with a drink of their choice to the top, fill the second with an inch of water and place the third empty cup closely in front of the the second cup. The wearable token must be sitting somewhere closeby ready for the game to start.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
At the signal of a designated referee or countdown, the players must race to the finish by performing the 4 challenges below:

1.  Prerequisite shots only if required (explained below within the red text)
2.  Bounce the ping pong ball onto the table into your cup
3.  Drink the contents of the cup until empty
4.  Place the cup you just drank from inside the cup which contains the water. Blow into the gap between these cups so that the top cup flies out of the cup with water in and lands into the 3rd cup which should also be empty.
5.  Take the two empty cups and flip both of these separately from right side up to upside down in order to win.

If you are the winner, you're exempt from any further games, unless you choose to play.

If you are the loser, you MUST wear the token and play again if requested by anyone. However, each loss you take has a price of 1 shot each time you play. At the start of each game you must take as many shots as you have obtained in losses before starting the challenges (the amount of losses = the amount of shots).

The loser must then hold the token until they can find a new challenger or a challenger finds them.

This game is essentially never ending and sends the repeating loser into oblivion unless the token is destroyed. The token is only worthy of destruction if a chunder is performed by the player wearing it.
