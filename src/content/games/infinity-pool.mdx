<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Start with one person picking up the pouring cup and pouring as much or as little water in the centre cup being sure to not let it spill over.

If the water doesn't overflow out of the cup and spill onto the table, the pouring cup is passed to the next player in the circle.

If the water spills, the game is over and the loser who made it spill must take a shot.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   As long as water is transferred from the pouring cup to the centre cup, it is a valid pour.
-   The centre cup cannot be touched or interacted with other than pouring water into it.
-   Shaking of the table is not allowed, any player who shakes the table causing the water to spill takes a shot.
-   Blowing the cup is not allowed, any player who blows on the cup causing the water to spill takes a shot.

<h4>Big drop</h4>

Rather than using a table, the centre cup sits on the floor and all players must pour water with straight legs and back.

-   If any water from pouring or the centre cup touching the floor, that player loses and must take a shot (minor splashes are excused).
-   A pouring jug can be used to make pouring easier
-   No stomping, any player who stomps causing the water to spill takes a shot.
