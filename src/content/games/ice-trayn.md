### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Be the team that finishes their ice trays before any other team to win the race

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

On the countdown of 3, the first player in each team must race to drink their ice tray of alcohol with their straw.

Once a player consumes their entire ice tray, they must flip their tray over and then the next player in the team can take their turn

If a player spills alcohol from their tray, it must be refilled before drinking any more

The first team to drink all alcohol from their trays and have them flipped over wins the race

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Players can hold straws before their teammates finish their trays.
-   If a tray is flipped and spills a considerable amount of alcohol, play must be paused to judge whether the tray is refilled.
-   No tray disruption allowed
-   All straws must be identically sized

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Shot Trayn**

-   Each spot within the trays should be filled with hard spirits instead of beer etc.
-   All players can drink at the same time
-   Players can choose to drink from different spots in different trays if needed
-   Each tray must have multiple different spirits within it
