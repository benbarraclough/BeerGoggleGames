### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Burn holes in the napkin without making the coin drop into the cup.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The player holding the lighter starts first by burning a hole in the napkin as big or as little as they wish yet trying not to make the coin fall into the empty cup.

If a player burns part of the napkin, they must make sure that it isn't on fire anymore and pass the lighter clockwise to the next player.

If the coin falls into the cup, the player whos turn it is loses. They must then clean the cup out and all other participants fill the cup with their drinks for the loser to consume as punishment

Once the drink has been consumed, the loser must place a new napkin and the coin on top of the cup to begin the next round.

This is played until there is a house fire

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   The lighter cannot be passed on until the fire has been extinguished
-   Whoever is holding the lighter at the time the coin falls into the cup loses
-   Blowing is permitted to extinguish fire
-   Touching of the napkin, cup or coin is not permitted
-   Deodorant is not advised anywhere near the game
-   The napkin can be lit on fire from anywhere, not just the edges

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **singe Extreme**

-   For each second a player lights the napkin on fire, they can issue 1 sip out to another player
-   Left hand lighting only, if a player touches the lighter with their right hand they must take a sip
-   If a player burns the napkin from inside the ring of the cup, they can give out 2 sips to another player
