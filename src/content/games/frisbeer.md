### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Throw the frisbee into your opponents target area to make them drink.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Starting with the team who first grabs the frisbee, one of the players must attempt to throw the frisbee into the other teams target area.

If the thrower scores, the whole opposing team must drink as many sips necessary. The inner ring is 3 sips, the middle ring is 2 sips, the outer ring is 1 sip.

If the thrower hits another player with the frisbee, the player hit must take a sip.

If the frisbee misses, the thrower must take a sip.

The game finishes once all players on a team finish their drinks. The winning team is the team who still have drink remaining.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   If the frisbee lands in two different areas, it counts as the inner most ring that it lands in.
-   Players in a team must take turns when throwing.
-   If drinks are given out, they must be drank before the frisbee is next thrown.
-   If a false throw is thrown, whichever team is next to pick up the frisbee gets the next turn.
