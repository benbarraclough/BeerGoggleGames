<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Start the game by counting down from 3 and then play can begin by each player drinking and flipping a cup at a time the same as regular flip cup, but each player has multiple cups.

Once a team or individual if playing alone drinks and flips all cups before any other team, they stay in the competition.

If a team or individual is the last to finish, they are knocked out of the competition.

This continues knocking 1 person or team out each round until there is only 1 left who is crowned the winner.
