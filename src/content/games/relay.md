### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Be the first team to pass through the obstacle course and consume all drinks to win the race.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

To begin, the starting player of each team must grab the bat/stick and follow the steps below.

Step 1: Place your forehead on the bat/stick and run around in 5 times.

Step 2: Drop the bat/stick and run through the obstacle course to the table.

Step 3: Finish your drink and flip the cup successfully.

Step 4: Run back to your team and tag the next player to take their turn

This continues in the same fashion until each player on 1 team has completed each step and returned back to the starting line.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   Cups can be filled with any drink available but must be the same amount
-   Cups must be flipped from right side up to upside down
-   For the next player to take their turn, they must be tagged by the previous player
-   As many teams as possible can play at once

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Circuits**

Make a circuit of obstacles giving each player in each team a different part of the course to complete. Each player will pass the bat/stick to the next player so that each player can use it to run around and as a signifier to start their stage.
