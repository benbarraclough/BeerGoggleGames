<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The player to first "propose a game of Fuzzy Duck" to their left begins, the player to the left of them must say "Fuzzy Duck", this then continues clockwise until someone chooses to say "Does he?"

When someone says "Does he?", the direction of the game switches and goes anti-clockwise. As the game switches direction, players must then change the phrase to "Ducky Fuzz", this then continues anticlockwise until someone chooses to say "Does he?".

The game goes on in this fashion switching back and forth until someone messes up by either saying "Duzzy Fuck", "Fucky Duzz" or other incorrect phrases.

Whenever someone says the wrong phrase or mispronounces the saying, they have to drink. This will happen surprisingly quickly.

The player who messes up starts the game off again by proposing a new game to the player next to them. This continues until all drink is consumed.

If you think you're group are getting too good at the game and need more of a challenge, add one or all of the extended set of rules.

-   If a player messes up in consecutive rounds, they must drink twice the amount they drank the previous round as punishment.
-   If the game is moving anti-clockwise, the phrase to switch directions changes to "Does she?" instead of "Does he?" (clockwise gameplay remains the same).
-   A switch can be replied to with "He does!" or "She does!". This reply then switches the game back again but to the player next but one (e.g. Player A says "fuzzy Duck", player B says "Does he?", player A says "he does!", player C says "fuzzy duck").
-   Knockout: Players get 2 lives, whoever messes up loses and life and when you're eliminated, you must finish your drink.
