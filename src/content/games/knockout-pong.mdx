<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The first player starts the game by attempting their shot from behind the marker using the table to bounce the ball off, the game then begins and the second player may take their shot in the same manner.

If the first player scores their shot into one of the 3 cups, they must retrieve their ball, pass it to the next player in the line and move to the back of the queue.

If the first player misses their initial shot, they can attempt to shoot from wherever they like but only by bouncing the ball off the table top into one of the cups in order to complete their turn.

If the second player scores their shot before the first player, the first player is knocked out of the game and the balls are passed to the next two players in the line whilst the player who knocked the other player out moves to the back of the queue.

This continues at high pace in a repetitive manner and doesn't end until there is just 1 player remaining. The last player remaining is the winner and may choose one player to face a forfeit.
