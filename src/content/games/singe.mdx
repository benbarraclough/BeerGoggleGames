<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The player holding the lighter starts first by burning a hole in the napkin as big or as little as they wish yet trying not to make the coin fall into the empty cup.

If a player burns part of the napkin, they must make sure that it isn't on fire anymore and pass the lighter clockwise to the next player.

If the coin falls into the cup, the player whos turn it is loses. They must then clean the cup out and all other participants fill the cup with their drinks for the loser to consume as punishment

Once the drink has been consumed, the loser must place a new napkin and the coin on top of the cup to begin the next round.

This is played until there is a house fire
