<GameSection title="Setup" icon="/images/settings.webp">
Gather all participants round a table and unpack the cards. Separate the deck by grouping the cards into numbered sets, then take as many sets as there are players participating and shuffle them together. Discard the rest of the cards for now. After mixing well, blindly take one card out of the deck and place it to the side before adding 1 joker to the mix. Shuffle again and deal each player 4 cards face down so that they are hidden. (Whilst the game can be played with 3 players, it is better with more).

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
All players begin at the same time on the count of 3. When the game starts, players may swap cards as quickly or slowly as they wish in order to collect a set of 4 cards with the same number.

Once a player has collected a complete set of cards, they should be flipped over to show that they are withdrawn from the game and can no longer participate.

Once the game gets down to its last 2 players, the game moves onto the finale.

Lucky dip finale: The remaining two players must participate in a finale to decide who the loser is. Shuffle the remaining cards still in play and spread them out them face down in the centre. 1 by 1, each player picks a card and flips.

If it is a number, the game continues.

if it is a joker, that player is the loser and must then finish the centre chug cup.

Cards can then be shuffled to play again.
