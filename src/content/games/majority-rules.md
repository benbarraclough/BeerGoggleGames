### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Guess the same as the king by showing a hand or a fist to prevent yourself from drinking and losing lives

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Each player has 3 lives

The player left of the host goes first by announcing that they are king and counting down from 3. Once the countdown ends, everyone including the king must show a fist or a hand.

If a player matches with the king, they are safe

If all players match with the king, the king must take 4 sips from their own royal goblet and all other players gain a life

If a player guesses differently to the king, they must take 2 sips from their drink and lose 1 of their lives

After each round of showing fists and hands, the king status switches to the next person in the circle which proceeds clockwise.

When a player has lost all lives, they must finish their drink and remove themself from the game. The game continues until there is only 1 player left, who remains the king and can pass out forfeits to the losers.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   No delays allowed in showing fists or hands
-   king status only remains for one round
-   No lying about how many lives you have remaining

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Modified rules**

-   The king retains status whilst they are in the majority
-   If all players guess differently to the king, the king loses a life as well (apart from the final round with only 2 people)
