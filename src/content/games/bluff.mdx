Gather players around a table with a filled drink each, shuffle the cards and create a pyramid placing a random selection of cards face down, a row of 5 at the bottom up to 1 at the top. Then provide each player 3 cards each face down, keeping them secret from other players.

<p>Dish out as many drinks as you can without getting caught lying about the cards in your hand.</p>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
To begin, any player may turn over the bottom left card of the pyramid displaying the first card to the group.

If a player in the group has a card in their hand with the same rank as the one turned over, they may shout up and give out drinks to any other player in the group.

If a player in the group does not have a card in their hand with the same rank as the one turned, they have a choice of two options.  
1\. Say nothing  
2\. Bluff and tell someone to take a drink

Once a player claims they have the card and gives out drinks to another, the person told to drink can either drink what they've been told or call their bluff.

If a players bluff is called, that player must drink double the designated drinks. If the player was not bluffing, the original player told to drink must drink double the designated drinks.

A player who is forced to show their cards is entitled to change the used card for a new card from the deck

This continues until the cards of the pyramid are all flipped

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/images/rules.webp">
-   The only cards flipped for all to see can be the pyramid cards and the specific card in a persons deck that has been flipped (for proof).
-   If a card is accidentally shown to the group, it cannot be replaced.
-   The next card on the pyramid can only be flipped once everyone gives the nod.
-   Drink allocations are set for each row and increase up the pyramid, this must be agreed before the game starts.

<p>To add more action to the game, players must lie their cards face down and remember them throughout the whole game without checking. If someone calls a player out and says they're bluffing, the player has to find the card - taking out the wrong card results in a penalty. At the end, when the pyramid is done, players take turns guessing their deck in the right order with a penalty for wrong guesses.</p>
