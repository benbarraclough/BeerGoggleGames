<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Game play starts with one can, which is still in its unopened state. Players take turns smashing the beer on their foreheads, yelling "Detonator!" as they do so.

If the beer does not burst, the can is then passed to the next player, who repeats the smashing and yelling.

Play continues until the structural integrity of the can is compromised. At this point, one player ends up covered in whatever alcohol is chosen. This player is declared the winner, and all losers are required to chug a full drink.

The game can then be repeated.

-   A player can withdraw from the game if they either obtain an injury.

<p>Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:</p>

<h4>Timer</h4>

<p>Add a timer to the game so that there is more urgency to crack the can. If the can doesn't crack within that time, everyone loses.</p>
