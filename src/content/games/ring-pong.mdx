Set up two regular beer pong triangles at either ends of the table, 10 cups each with drinks filled half way in each. Make sure the table has space all around so that you can walk all the way around. Half of the players should then stand behind one rack of cups and half behind the other with one player holding the ball ready to throw.

The person with the ball begins the game by throwing the ball to the other side of the table in attempt to score in a cup. After shooting, they must move clockwise to the other side of the table behind the other players who are currently queueing to take their shot.

If the shot is scored, the player who is next to take their shot must drink the cup that the ball has landed in.

If the shot misses, no action is required

After each shot, the next player to shoot grabs the ball and takes their shot before moving clockwise to the other side of table. This cycle continues so that all players are moving circular around the table in quick succession taking shots.

The game ends when all cups are gone.

<h4>Knockout</h4>

<p>The knockout version is a great option to add an extra element of competition. If you're the one who is scored against you lose a life, once a players' lives are lost they must remove themselves from the game. Based on the amount of people and the length of the game, the amount of lives can be changed. Start with 1 each and see how it is. The last player remaining wins and can issue the drinks out as punishments to whoever they wish.</p>
