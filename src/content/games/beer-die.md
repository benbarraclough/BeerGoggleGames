-   4 chairs

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Get 4 players together and separate into two teams, each with a solo cup filled 3/4 of the way with beer or a similar drink. Place 1 cup on each corner of the table and have each team sitting in front of their cups facing each other with the oldest player holding the die ready to begin.

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Score points for your team by throwing the die across the table into a players cup or other ways to win the game.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Between the teams, decide what the minimum height that the die must reach on each throw, this is usually the length of the table (a regulation 8 foot) if outside or the height of the tallest player if inside.

Once a decision has been made, the player holding the die must take their shot by throwing the die under-arm in the air from seated in attempt to score points.

Sink: If the shot lands in the oppositions cup, the offensive team are awarded 3 points and the defending team must kill and fill their beer regardless of the score

Tink: If the shot hits the defending sides cup and falls off the table without being caught, the offensive team are awarded 2 points.

If the shot bounces on the table and falls off the table without being caught, the offensive team are awarded 1 point.

If the shot bounces on the table and is caught correctly by the defending team, no points are scored.

If a rule is broken by the offensive team, the throw is void and the die gets passed to the other team.

If a rule is broken by the defensive team, points to the offensive team may be awarded accordingly.

Once a players throw is over, one of the members of the opposite team takes their turn.

This continues until a team reaches 9 points and wins. The losing team then must finish their drinks and begin another round or end the game.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   If a die is thrown under the minimum height, a player must shout "height" for the throw to be marked as void.
-   If the die is accidentally dropped on the floor or misses the table entirely on an offensive throw, both team members must take a sip.
-   The die must be tapped on the table before a player throws.
-   No catching with two hands.
-   No trapping (catching against your body).
-   No reaching over the table to catch.
-   A players throw must land/bounce on the other teams side of the table.
-   A sink shot can either go straight in or bounce in the cup.
-   As soon as the die hits the drink inside the cup, it classes as a sink, no matter if it bounces out.
-   If self sunk, the player must kill & fill.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Bonus Rules**

Pick and choose from the list of rules below to play your own version

-   FIFA: Any toss from the offensive team that misses the table can be kicked up by one of the defensive players and caught by the adjacent defensive player. If successfully caught, this can either award the defensive team a point or punish the offensive player that threw the air-ball die by making them sit out on defense for the next turn.
-   Spit 5’s: After a sink, the player must drink the die and hold it in their mouth before spitting it out onto the table (or just rolling it out of the cup). If that player spits (or rolls) a 5 then he must shotgun a beer or chug a beer out of his glass.
-   Skunked: If a team is loses 9 to 0 then they must choose to either run around the block completely naked or buy a pizza for the winners.
-   Forbidden: Do not say the numbers “5” or “7” during the game, or else you take 1 sip.
-   Bobbles: If both teams decide to play bobbles then the defending team cannot bobble the die at all or bobble it on purpose depending on how you want to play. If the die is bobbled and not caught cleanly then it is a point for the offensive team.
