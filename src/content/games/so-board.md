### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Complete each task that you're assigned to avoid forfeits

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Starting with the person whos coin it is, they must flip it onto the playing board.

If the coin lands on a blank space of the playing board, you must write a task and draw a circle around it.

If the coin lands on any part of a task circle, the task must be performed by the thrower

If the coin doesn't land anywhere on the playing board, you must sip 4 fingers of drink.

One by one, round the group you takes turns flipping the coin, creating Play until you're bored

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   If the coin lands on two different tasks, the group picks the one that is most relevant
-   Each time a player consecutively misses the playing board, they must take twice as many sips as the last
-   The coin only slightly needs to touch a task circle for it to be performed
-   Tasks can be anything! From rules, truths, dares, rewards and forfeits

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Multi-tasking**

If your coin lands on multiple tasks, they become tasks for others in the group rather than yourself and can be assigned to anyone you choose
