### Equipment ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   Deck of cards
-   Centre chug cup
-   A table

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Gather all participants round a table and unpack the cards. Separate the deck by grouping the cards into numbered sets, then take as many sets as there are players participating and shuffle them together. Discard the rest of the cards for now. After mixing well, blindly take one card out of the deck and place it to the side before adding 1 joker to the mix. Shuffle again and deal each player 4 cards face down so that they are hidden. (Whilst the game can be played with 3 players, it is better with more).

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Collect a matching set of cards (4 of the same number) to withdraw from the game.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

All players begin at the same time on the count of 3. When the game starts, players may swap cards as quickly or slowly as they wish in order to collect a set of 4 cards with the same number.

Once a player has collected a complete set of cards, they should be flipped over to show that they are withdrawn from the game and can no longer participate.

Once the game gets down to its last 2 players, the game moves onto the finale.

Lucky dip finale: The remaining two players must participate in a finale to decide who the loser is. Shuffle the remaining cards still in play and spread them out them face down in the centre. 1 by 1, each player picks a card and flips.

If it is a number, the game continues.

if it is a joker, that player is the loser and must then finish the centre chug cup.

Cards can then be shuffled to play again.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   Cards can only by swapped one at a time.
-   A player cannot have more than 4 cards in hand at any time.
-   If a player is caught marking the joker card, they automatically lose.
-   When swapping cards, you cannot pass the joker back to the player you received it from.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Frozen out**

If a player knows who has the joker at that time, they can call out “you fuckin joker” whilst pointing. If they are correct, the player with the joker is frozen out for 20 seconds. If wrong, the player who called out is frozen out for 20 seconds.

If any of the following rules are broken, a player is frozen out for 5 seconds:

-   No right hand drinking
-   No swearing
-   No elbows on the table
-   No less than 3 cards in your hand at any time
-   No touching hands
