### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Toss the solo cup so it lands on top of the oppositions beer bottle and they have to drink.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

The starting team begins by throwing their cup(s) and attempting to land them over the top of one of the oppositions bottles.

Once all cups have been thrown by the team, the cups can be picked up and thrown by the opposing team.

If a cup successfully lands on a bottle without knocking it over. The player who’s drink it is must finish it at the end of the round.

The game continues until a team loses all of its bottles. The remaining bottles on the winning team must then be drank by the losers.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   Knees cannot be bent when throwing.
-   Neither cups or bottles cannot be interfered with during a throw session.
-   If a cup lands on a bottle and is knocked off or falls off before the end of the round, it does not count.
-   If a bottle is smashed, it should be replaced.
-   If a player has no cups left in the game they can no longer throw.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Circle toss off**

no teams needed, it’s a free for all. Everyone gets in a circle with their own two beer bottles at their feet. With two cups on the go, each player in the group must try and throw the cup onto another’s cup bottle to make them drink. Once both players’ bottles are gone, the player is knocked out. The last player remaining wins and gets to hand their remaining bottle(s) to another player.
