<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The most Irish looking player goes first by picking up the cup with the dice & coin in and shaking it with their hand over the top whilst choosing either heads or tails. Once decided, the player must slam the cup upside down on the table with the dice & coin underneath and slowly reveal what side the coin has landed on.

If the player guesses the side of the coin correctly, no drinking happens and then they must pass the cup over to the next player to take their turn.

If the player guesses the side of the coin incorrectly, they must look at the number rolled on the dice and drink that many sips.

The loser can contest their drinks by rolling the dice out of the cup and guessing the number, which if correctly guessed would revoke their punishment and move to the next player. However, if this is guessed wrong, the number on the second dice roll is added to the number of sips required.

This is played until drunk or until the game loses the dice/coin after a player gets angry at their bad luck.

<GameSection title="XL Rules:" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
-   The luck of the Irish: If you guess 3 coin flips in a row correctly, you get to give out 3 sips to participants in the game
-   The luck of the devil: If you guess 3 coin flips in a row incorrectly, the player must now take shots instead of taking sips until the luck is reversed and thy guess correctly
-   Risk: A player may choose to guess the coin side as well as the number on the dice at the same time on their turn. If guessed correctly, every other player in the game must finish their drinks. If guessed incorrectly, that player must drink their drink
-   2: If a player guesses the coin flip correctly and the number on the dice is a 2, they can give out two sips to whoever they like.
-   6: If a player guesses the coin flip correctly and the number on the dice is a 6, it skips the next player in line to take their turn.
