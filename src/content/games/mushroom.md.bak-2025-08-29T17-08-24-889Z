-   52 Card Deck
-   1 drink container

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Balance cards on top of a drink without the the rest of the cards toppling too

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Starting with the youngest in the group, they must take a card from the deck and place it on the cup with a minimum of two corners hanging off the edge.

If the card stays on, the next person in the group attempts to place a card on top of the rest of the cards

If the card falls you must take a sip and try placing it again

If the card falls alongside other cards, you lose the game and must drink the centre drink

After 5 or 6 cards are placed, the mushroom is formed and this is played until the mushroom crumbles to the ground.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   2 corners of each card must be floating over the edge when placed
-   If the card you placed falls and only that card, it can be re-placed
-   As soon as the next player picks up a card to place, they are responsible for any falling cards from the mushroom
-   Shaking or disrupting the stability of the mushroom is punished by 2 sips
-   If someone disrupts and topples the cards on the mushroom, they lose the game, even if it is not their turn

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Double Stack**

Double Stack your mushroom by placing a second drink filled cup on top of the first and starting a new game. The odds are higher and the loser must drink both cups
