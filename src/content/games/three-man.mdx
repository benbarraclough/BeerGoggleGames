<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The game starts by the Three Man rolling the dice and performing whichever task(s) is required as noted below.

Threes: If you roll a three or both the dice add up to the sum of 3, the Three Man must drink.

Seven: For any roll that totals 7, everyone drinks.

Eight: For any roll that totals 8, the person to the left of roller drinks.

Nine: For any roll that totals 9, the person to the right of roller drinks.

Eleven: For any roll thats totals 11, the Three Man changes to the person who rolled this total. If the current Three Man rolls eleven, they can choose who the next Three Man is and can pass them the hat.

Doubles: If you roll doubles, you can pass the dice to the player(s) of your choice. You can either pass both dice to 1 person or split them up and give 2 people 1 die apiece. The player(s) that receive the dice must then roll to find out how many drinks they must take. If the dice you passed result in a doubles roll (whether you split them between 2 people or not) you must drink the sum of the dice instead.

The dice are then passed to the next player around the circle to take their turn. This game can be played for as long as everyone has alcohol to drink.

-   Multiple players can drink from a single roll (e.g. a 3 and a 6 would make the Three Man drink and the person to the right of the roller)
-   The dice must be passed clockwise around the circle
-   If the dice land on the floor, this is still a valid roll
-   No disrupting players from their rolls
