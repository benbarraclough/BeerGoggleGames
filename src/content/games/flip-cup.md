### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Chug your drinks and flip your cups quicker than the other team to win

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Everyone playing must begin by counting down from 3 to begin. Once the game starts, only the first player in each team can begin chugging their drink as quick as they can. Once finishing the drinks, they must place the cup the right way up on the edge of the table and flip it so that it lands upside down on the table.

If the flip is made, the game moves onto the next person in the line.

If the flip isn't made, the player must proceed to try and land the flip.

The game finishes when one team has drank and flipped all of their cups successfully.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   The flip can spin in the air as many times as the player wants
-   The cup can't be tampered with mid-flip
-   The next player can't take their turn or touch their cup until the previous player lands their flip
-   All cups must be filled equally
