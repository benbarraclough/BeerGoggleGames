### Equipment ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   Frisbee
-   2 Poles
-   2 Empty bottles/cans

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Stick two poles about 6 feet tall into the ground about 20-40 feet apart. Place a bottle or can on top of each pole so it is stable but can be knocked off. The group of players should then divide into two teams and stand by their teams pole (one team holing the frisbee). If you find this tricky to set up, you could also use a long stick with an upsidedown cup placed on top of it.

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Knock the bottle/can off the pole the other teams pole using the frisbee to earn points and make the other team drink.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Decide between you all whether the winning score should be 11 or 21 before the game begins and then the game can commence.

The team with the frisbee begins on offense by one team member throwing a frisbee in attempt to make the other team's bottle/can hit the floor.

You can either strike the bottle directly and knock it to the ground, or strike the pole so the bottle falls off.

If the thrower hits the bottle/can, knocking it off the pole, scores are given based on the following outcomes:

-   Defense misses the bottle and the disc = 3 points for the offense
-   Defense catches eithert the bottle or the disc = 2 points for the offense
-   Defense catches both bottle and the disc = 1 point for the offense

If the thrower hits the pole which knocks off the bottle/can, scores are given based on the following outcomes:

-   Defense misses both the bottle and the disc = 2 points for the offense
-   Defense catches either the bottle or the disc = 1 point for the offense
-   Defense catches both bottle and the disc = 0 points for the offense

If the offense misses the pole and bottle/can, 0 points are given

The offensive team gets two throws per turn and then hands the frisbee over to the other team who then becomes offense.

This is repeated whilst keeping track of team scores throughout the game until one team reaches either 11 or 21.

Each player on the losing team should then drink a bottle, cup, can of whatever you have available as forfeit.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   All defensive players must remain behind their pole and cannot interfere with a throw.
-   Scores can only be given to the offending team.
-   Throws must be from behind the offenses own pole.
-   Both striking the bottle and the pole with the frisbee are valid methods of scoring.
-   Hitting the bottle/can twice in a row gets the offense a third throw using the throwers' weak hand (however this does not then apply for a fourth, fifth etc.)

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Quick Sip Rules**

Use these rules to up the intensity of the game

-   Rather than scoring using points, treat the points like amount of sips. (e.g. 2 points for the offense = 2 sips for the defense).
-   Drinks must be held in hand at all times during the game.
-   If the defense does not catch the frisbee on a catchable throw, the offense gets 1 point.
-   If the frisbee falls short, it can be grabbed by either team (a re-throw would be possible for the offense, the defense would only gain from this by preventing th re-throw).
