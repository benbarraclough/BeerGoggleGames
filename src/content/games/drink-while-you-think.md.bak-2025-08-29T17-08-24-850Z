### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Come up with quick answers to limit the time you're drinking.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

The game starts with the first person in the circle saying the name of a celebrity or someone famous out loud to the group (e.g. Bruce Willis).

The next person in the circle must then say the name of another celebrity, the first letter of the first name starting with the last letter of the previous answers last name. (e.g. Will Smith)

This then continues until somebody chokes, passes or gives up.

The player who gives up first must take a shot.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   If a player does not drink whilst they think, an appeal can be made by other players as to how many seconds of drinking they should do as punishment.
-   If a person gives an incorrect answer or a repeat answer, they must continue to think and drink until a successful answer is given. After this they must pay a drink debt of 3 seconds.
-   If a person cannot think of an answer, they get 1 pass per game which costs a drink debt of 5 seconds.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

#### **Reverse move**

To spice the game up a bit, the direction of flow can be reversed if anyone uses the following answers:

-   A celebrity whose first and last name begins with the same letter
-   A celebrity who goes by only 1 name (e.g. Zendaya)
-   A celebrity with the same first or last name as the previous answer
