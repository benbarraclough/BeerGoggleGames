<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
The player holding the bottle, passes it to any other person playing.

The player receiving the bottle takes a shot directly from the bottle.

The passing player gets to slap the receiver in the face as hard or as soft as desired.

Continue passing the bottle and Repeat. The game ends when the bottle is empty.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/images/rules.webp">
-   You cannot pass the bottle to the player who passed it to you (unless playing within a group of 2 or 3)
-   If the group believes a player hasn't taken their shot properly, they can object which makes the player take another
-   Players can remove themselves from the game at any time
-   The player passing the drink decides how hard they will slap the other player

<h4>Spin Slaps</h4>

<p>Instead of the players picking who will drink next, 'the passer' turns into 'the spinner' and must place the cap on the bottle before spinning it in the middle of the group. Whoever the bottle points to when stopped gets slapped by the spinner and must take a hot. This is then repeated.</p>
