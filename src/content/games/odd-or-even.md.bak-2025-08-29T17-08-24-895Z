### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Guess correctly whether the dice rolled will be odd or even to issue drinks out to other players.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Take it in turns to call either "Even" or "Odd" before rolling the dice.

If a player guesses both numbers correctly (e.g. Calls Even and the dice show a 2 & 6) then the player gives out 1 sip to another player.

If a player guesses only 1 number correctly, they take 1 sip themselves

If a player guesses both numbers incorrectly, they must take 2 sips and roll again.

After each players turn has ended, they must then pass the dice clockwise for the next player to go.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   The call must be made before the dice are rolled
-   Dice that land on the floor when rolled still count
-   If a player gets 3 guesses in a row wrong, they must retain the dice until they guess a roll correct.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Bonus Rules**

-   Split: Take a risk by calling a split - if guessed correctly (one even, one odd), every player except the roller must take a sip. If guessed incorrectly, the roller must drink the amount of sips signified by the dice with the highest number.
-   Sloppy Jalopy: Only rolls that land on the table count, if it lands anywhere else the roller must drink.
-   Double Trouble: If a double is guessed correctly, issue the amount of sips signified by the dice to another player. If guessed incorrectly, the roller takes these sips.
