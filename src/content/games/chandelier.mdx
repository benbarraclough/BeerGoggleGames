Fill your own solo cup with a drink of your choice and then decide between the group what will go in the centre chug cup and fill that. Once these are filled, form a chandelier (as in the image) with the centre cup on top of another upside down cup so it is higher than the rest which surround it. Each player should be standing in front their cup and know which is theirs.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Whoever has the ball starts by bouncing the ball on the table trying to get it in an opponents cup.

If the shot is scored in an opponents cup, they must finish the cup and refill before they shoot their turn.

If the shot misses, nobody drinks and the first person to grab the ball goes next

If the shot goes in the centre cup, everyone must compete to not drink the chug cup by racing to finish their cups and flipping them after finished from upside down to right way up. The last one to do this loses and must drink it

The game continues until everyone is too drunk to play

<GameSection title="**Rules**" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
Adding further rules will confuse people and create more drinking

**Such as:**-   If the ball hits one cup and then goes in another, both cups are drank
-   Each time a ball is stolen, the stealer must announce that its their ball (E.g. "Jim's ball!")
-   If you score the ball in your own cup, you must do an extra forfeit
-   Each player who drinks creates a new rule
