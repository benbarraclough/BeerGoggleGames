<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
As a group nominate a player to go first. This player must start by blowing the cards that are resting on the top of the drink as gently as possible in attempt to knock a card off the top of the deck.

If the player manages to blow one or more cards off the top of the deck without blowing the last card, the players' turn is over and the next player in the group must take their turn.

If the player blows the last card off top of the drink, they lose and must finish the centre drink.
