### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Roll number matches or sequences with the dice to not drink and make others drink at the same time.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The game begins like a game of Yahtzee where one player grabs the dice, puts them in the cup, shakes and rolls on the table.

The goal is to get one of the following sets:  
\- 5 of a kind (Yahtzee)  
\- 5 dice straight  
\- 4 of a kind  
\- 4 dice straight  
\- Full House (2 of one, three of another)

Each player gets 3 rolls to get one of the above sets, if a player wishes to roll a second or third time, they may pick as many dice up as they wish (e.g. if three 4's were rolled, the person can pick the other two dice up in an attempt to get more 4's)

If a player manages to get a set, they so not have to drink and can pass the dice and cup to the left.

If a player doesnt manage to get a set, they have to drink the amount of times they have rolled.

This continues until everyone has had enough and very drunk.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Any dice rolled on the floor are void and cannot be used.
-   Any dice kept cannot be touched or moved, they must stay in their place.
-   A drink must be had by the roller for every number 1 that is kept at the end of their turn.
-   If a 5 of a kind or yahtzee is rolled, everybody except the roller drinks.
-   No dice roll until shots are completed. Once someone is punished to drink, the next player in turn shouldn’t roll the dice until they finish drinking.

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Version 2**

This version is closer to the real game of Yahtzee using the scoresheet, free here: [Scoresheet.pdf](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~davis/yahtzee.pdf)

The original rules and gameplay for Yahtzee can be found here: [How to play Yahtzee](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Yahtzee)

#### In addition to the normal rules, for alcoholic fun follow these too

-   Ace is cursed - When you throw the dice, you have to drink for every Ace (or every One).
-   The waterfall. Once a player gets a large or small straight, all players, starting from the thrower, start a waterfall.
-   Yahtzee - When this is rolled, the roller can give drinks based on the number of Yahtzee. For instance, if you got all 3s, you can make 3 people drink, or make one player take 3 sips.
-   Sixes - Everyone drinks when there’s a pair of Six. If 2 of your dice show 6, everyone in the group drinks.
-   Drink for an extra roll. If you need just a few points to achieve your goal, you can get one extra roll (for all 5 dice). That will cost you to finish your drink.
-   End of the game rules - Once you calculate all points, all the other players besides the winner drink, based on these rules:  
    One sip if the difference between your points and the winner is 25 to 50 points.  
    Two sips if the difference is 50 to 100 points.  
    Finish your drink if the difference is 100 or more points.
