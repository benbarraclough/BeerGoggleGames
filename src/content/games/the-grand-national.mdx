Gather as many players as possible to play, this is The Grand National, the more the merrier. Pick out all four Aces from the deck and place them face up side by side, whilst placing 8 cards above each other in a line to the side of the aces as "hurdles" (shown within the image).

<p>Pick the correct suit that wins The Grand National horse race.</p>
</GameSection>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
To start, each player must pick a suit that they think will win the race. After everyone has chosen, the host must cut the betting off and refuse any further changes.

The game then proceeds by the host commentating the race and creating an exciting atmosphere to simulate a live horse race. This person must then flip a card from the top of the deck and reveal its suit to the participants. Whichever card is picked is added to the row of that suit, making it 1 step closer to the finish.

When a suit reaches 9 cards in its row and passes the markers on the side (the finish line), the game ends and players who bet on that suit win & do not have to drink

Players who do not win the race drink as many fingers of their drink as there are hurdles left to jump for their suit.

<h4>Wagers</h4>

<p>Bet by wagering sips of drinks and posssibly shots. Each player has a set amount of sips and shots which the host must take note of within a notepad. These sips and shots can be wagered with so that if won, thse can be distrbuted between other players. If lost when wagering these however, the player must take those sips themselves.</p>
