<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the player who raises their hand in the air last, they must take a turn to pick a card from the centre and perform the task outlined below based on the number. This continues one player at a time moving clockwise around the circle.

If it is a number then it must be placed under the can tab on top of the can.

If it is any of the below cards, the required sips must be taken.

Ace = 4 sips

King = 3 sips

Queen = 2 sips

Jack = 1 sip

Joker (optional) = 1 shot

If a player cracks the seal of the can and opens it by placing a card under the tab, that player loses and must finish the tinny.

This is played until the seal of the can is cracked. If all cards have been turned and the seal has not cracked (unlikely), take it in turns to place face cards under the tab.
