### Equipment ![target](images/liquor.webp)

-   1-3 Pong balls
-   A table
-   14 Solo cups

### Setup ![target](images/settings.webp)

Gather players into teams (preferably 8 people in teams of 4) and line up the plastic cups on your pong table with alcohol in as shown in the diagram below. Teams decide who defends first and start by positioning themselves as shown in the diagram. In this instance, the black team will be “leading off” the inning and the white team will be defending (DF). Both teams should agree to how many innings will be played to complete the game. Three fingers of drink should be added to each cup on the table and the game can begin once the leading team have hold of the ball.

### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Score as many runs as possible by getting the ball into the cups and stop the other team from scoring.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The first team up to bat starts the game by throwing ping pong balls at the four cups that are lined up on the opposite side of the table. Each player takes it in turns to throw their three balls each.

Scoring: The cup closest to the batter is a “single”, second is a “double”, third is a “triple”, and fourth is a “home run”. When the batter sinks their ball into a cup they will move to the allotted base. For example, if you hit a double, you will go stand in the second base area. After a batter sinks their ping pong ball in a cup, the other team is responsible for drinking the cup. Once a home run is scored, the batter joins the back of the line to bat again.

Strike & penalties: If the batter misses their throw, the batter receives a strike. Three strikes and your out! The other two ways a player can be given an out is if their throw is caught after bouncing off the rim of a cup or a throw misses the table and cups completely. These are both straight outs, no strikes.

Moving bases: If a player is on base they must be forced-in to score a run. For example, if a player is on second base and the next batter hits a double, the first player who was on second base moves up to third base. It would then take another double, triple, or home run to score the lead runner.

Stealing: Once you are on-base you have the ability to steal a base to advance closer to scoring a run. To do so you can spontaneously drink the cup in front of your base and try to flip it 180 degrees off the edge of the table and have it land upside down (flip cup). This can be done anytime during a teammates at-bat. Stealing bases don’t count if there are three outs.

Defending: The defender opposite of the base stealer has a chance to “throw out” the base stealer by drinking their cup and flipping it upside down faster than the base stealer. If the defender completes the flip first, the base runner is out and must head to the back of his team’s batting line. If the base stealer completes the flip first he can advance to the next base. Once arriving at this new base the runner may decide to stop or continue “running” by drinking and flipping the cup at the new base. The new defender can try to “throw out” the stealer but cannot start drinking or flipping his cup until the defender from the previous bag completes his flip.

Once 3 players in a team are out, the innings flips and the defenders are now batting. The above is repeated until the innings comes to an end. Runs are counted up and marked down before the next innings starts.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   The defence can only interfere with the ball once it bounces.
-   Strikes reset after a player scores.
-   Multiple players can be on one base.

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Every man for themself**

Each player bats for themselves and has three turns to score at least one run or else they strike out. If you strike out you're knocked out of the game. If you score you get to join the back of the queue and bat again. The player with the most runs after a certain amount of innings (or until everyone is knocked out) wins.
