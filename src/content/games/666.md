### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Get rid of the bad luck token as quick as possible to avoid the vengeance that comes with it.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

To begin the game, a player must start the timer and the player with the dice must take their turn to roll the dice, perform what the number says and pass the dice to the next player as quickly as possible.

Number 1 = Roller takes the token

Number 2 = Double the time for token holder

Number 3 = The token holder drinks 1 sip

Number 4 = Everyone takes a sip

Number 5 = The token holder drinks 3 sips

Number 6 = The token holder pours and drinks a shot for themself

Triple = If three consecutive players roll the same number, everybody drinks.

Each time the timer elapses 15 seconds in time, the token can be passed clockwise to the next player, which means rolling the dice quickly is in each players best interest (unless they have the token).

This is played for as long as wanted, there is no particular winner which is why its a good game to get everyone pissed.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   The stopwatch and game can be paused to establish order
-   If the timer is paused, dice rolls do not count
-   If the timer is paused for no reason, 1 punishment sip is given to the player who paused it
-   No delays in rolling the dice if you have the token
-   If a player needs to roll and drink at the same time, they must roll first

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)
