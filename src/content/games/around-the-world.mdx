Gather your group in a circle and make sure everyone has a drink. The more players the better, as this is a social game and has no limit on the amount of players playing.

<p>Don't mess up and keep the chain of answers going</p>
</GameSection>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the game organiser, each player must name a country. Each answer (except the starting answer) must start with the letter the previous answer ends on.

E.g. France, Ecuador, Romania etc.

If you say an answer that fits in, the play moves to the next person in the circle

If you say an answer theat doesnt fit in or can't think of an answer, you must take a sip of your own drink and start the next round with a new country.

Play this for as long as you like and maybe change up the rules.
