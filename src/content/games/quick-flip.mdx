Find someone to play 1 on 1 with, position a player on either side of the table with a cup each and a centre drink. Place the section markers from one side of the table to the other, all parallel and equal distance of around 3 inches from each other. The straws represent sections and in the centre section must be placed the centre chug cup with a filled drink of choice as the forfeit.

<GameSection title="Aim of the Game" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/target.webp">

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Everyone starts at the same time after a countdown from 3 by flipping their own cup repeatedly in order to score a point.

If you score a point you get to move the centre cup into the next section further away from you. Once moved, you must do this again and again in order to win.

If you fail to flip successfully, you can just keep trying. Your only enemy is time in this game, as the other team will be fighting against you to move the cup away from them and towards you.

If the cup is moved outside of all straws, completely onto one players side of the table, that team loses and must drink the chug cup.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   If either team scores a point and needs to move the cup at the same time, the cup stays where it is.
-   The chug cup must be reachable by all players at all times from their playing spot.
-   Each players cup is to be flipped right side up to upside down.
-   Not interference with the flipping of cups is allowed.

<p>Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:</p>

<h4>Teamplay</h4>

<p>Play the game with a bit more social interaction by having 2 players on each team, with one cup each. For this version of the game you may need a couple more sections so that it doesn't end so quickly.</p>
