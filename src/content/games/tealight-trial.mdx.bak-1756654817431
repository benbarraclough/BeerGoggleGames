<p>Blow as many candles out as possible with one puff.</p>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
One by one, each player must step up to the table facing down the line of candles and blow as many candles out as possible with one breath. The amount of candles are then recorded, the candles are relit and the next player takes their turn.

Once everyone has taken their turn, the player who blew out the least amount of candles loses and must take a sip as punishment.

The game is then repeated for multiple rounds until finished.
