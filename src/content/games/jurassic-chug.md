### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Be the first team to pass, drink and flip all cups onto the table with only mouths to win.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The game starts after a countdown of 3, then the first player in each team begins by performing step 1.

Step 1: The first player in each team must then supply drinks down the line to their teammates via their mouth.

Step 2: One after the next, each player in each team must take it in turns to finish their drink using only their mouths.

Step 3: After each player has finished their drink they must place the empty cup of theirs onto the table upside down.

The first team to have all cups on the table flipped upside down and empty wins.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   If any drink is spilled, a 5 second penalty is issued
-   If a player touches a cup with any other part of the body other than the mouth, a 5 second penalty is issued
-   The next player in the team cannot drink until the previous player has finished their drink
-   To hold drinks, players can use their mouth or place the cup down

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

#### **Extreme Rules**

Instead of each player taking it in turns to drink their own drink, each teammate should be 'Penguin Fed' by another player on their team (expanded on in our glossary page. The first person must feed the second player and so on until the last person who then must feed the first person.
