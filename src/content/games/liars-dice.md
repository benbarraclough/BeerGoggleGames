### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Correctly guess the number of dice rolled between the group to retain your dice for the longest.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

To decide who begins, each player rolls one die, the player with the highest number starts.

Each player in the group puts all their dice in their empty cup and shakes it to mix them up. After shaking, each player slams the cup upside down on the table so that the dice hit the table with the cup covering them. Ensure that all dice are flat on the table by sliding the cup a little.

The starting player begins by stating a minimum amount of a certain number they think there is under all cups. (E.g. “4 twos”). The first statement can be as low or as high as the player wishes.

The next player has 5 choices:

1.  Take the bid higher (E.g. "5 twos")
2.  Switch number
3.  Call Aces
4.  Call Liar
5.  Call Dudo

If a player calls aces, they can change the bid to guess how many 1’s there are, the number can be halved. (E.g. 4 twos, can be changed to 2 aces). When switching back from aces, it must be doubled +1. The game can only switch to aces once per round and not in a 1vs1.

This continues around the table until somebody either calls liar or dudo which will end a round.

If a player calls liar and the minimum amount of dice called is correct, the caller loses a die. If the minimum amount of dice is incorrect, the bidder loses a die.

If a player calls dudo, they must attempt to guess the exact amount of a certain number. If the guess does not match, then the player loses a die. If it does match, they get to redeem a die from the centre.

When a round ends, the losing player must relinquish a die to the centre of the table. However, before this the die must be rolled. The number on the die indicates how many sips must be drank in punishment.

The last player who is holding dice at the end of the game wins.

When a player loses all of their dice, they must finish their drink.

A player can enter back into the game after getting knocked out by redeeming a die through redemption. Each player has 1 redemption attempt that can only be used if 3 or more people are still in the game. Redemption allows a player to make a dudo call of the exact amount of a certain number. If guessed wrong they must take 2 sips.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   If a player damages their cup, they must drink half a cups worth of drink.
-   Damaged cups can be hidden.
-   Play always moves clockwise.
-   A player can call Dudo at any time unless they are next to bid.
-   All sips must be taken before the next round commences.
-   Drinks must be refilled before each round.

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Blind**

The same game but without the use of sight. You cannot look at your dice when flipped so the results are more unpredictable. The punishment for a damaged cup is also doubled.
