<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Each player must choose 1 number on the dice, everybody should have a unique number.

Going round the table, each player must roll the dice in an attempt to roll their number.

If a player rolls their number, they should either note this down on a piece of paper or hold a finger up on their none throwing hand.

If a player rolls a number which is somebody elses, the player whose number it is must take a drink.

The game continues until somebody has rolled their own number three times, then they are out of the game.

The last person left in the game must take a forfeit.

<p>To play the game with more than 6 people, more dice can be added into the game. However, with this change, numbers are more likely to rolled than others and the number 1 is not used. To decide who gets which numbers from 2 - 12, players take turns rolling, whichever number they get first they keep.</p>
