### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Don't mess up and keep the chain of answers going

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Starting with the game organiser, each player must name a country. Each answer (except the starting answer) must start with the letter the previous answer ends on.

E.g. France, Ecuador, Romania etc.

If you say an answer that fits in, the play moves to the next person in the circle

If you say an answer theat doesnt fit in or can't think of an answer, you must take a sip of your own drink and start the next round with a new country.

Play this for as long as you like and maybe change up the rules.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   You can't skip a turn
-   Each player must have a drink
-   Answer within 5 seconds
-   No repeated answers

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Extra Rules**

-   Reverse - If an answer starts with the same it ends in, the play is reversed e.g. Seychelles
-   Next level - If everyone in the group answers correctly, everyone must drink
-   Next Category - Change the category to one of your choice after you're out of countries
