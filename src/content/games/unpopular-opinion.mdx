The player with the least liquid in their cup at the time begins by taking a sip and providing the first unpopular opinion to the group e.g. "I hate The Cat in the Hat".

The game proceeds with each person taking it in turns to do the same. Once everyone has said their opinion, each member in the group independently decides in their head which opinion they disagree with the most. At the end of a countdown from 3, each player votes by pointing at the person they have chosen.

If you are voted the least popular, you must take the forfeit and drink the centre cup.

If there is no loser, everyone takes a sip and moves onto the next round.

Players who give answers that aren't quite unpopular enough drink.

The round ends and the centre cup is refilled. The game then moves on to the next round and starts to the left of the the most popular person.
