The participating players (the more the better) sit on chairs in a circle preferably without a table in the way. The game master should then be announced which is usually the organiser, as they know the rules. The game master should then hold the game object which can be anything such as an empty plastic drink bottle or even a genuine pair of scissors.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
Starting with the game master, each player passes the object to the player on their left stating whether they are passing the scissors open or passing the scissors closed.

Each time a player passes the scissors, this is either done correctly based on the rule(s) behind the game. As each player does this the game master and others who know the rule say whether they have got the passing .

If the player takes their turn correctly, the game continues as normal.

If the player takes their turn incorrectly, the player must take a drink.

The objective of the game is to work out what is going on and consistently try to find the correct method of passing.

DO NOT DISCLOSE: The most common solution to this game is that scissors are passed closed if your legs (or even ankles) are crossed, or if the passer's hands are closed, and the scissors are passed open if uncrossed or if the passer has their hands open.

The game continues until either everyone knows the solution or everyone gets bored of guessing.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/images/rules.webp">
-   If scissors are passed without saying open or closed loud enough for everyone to hear, the passer must take a drink.
-   If a player works out the solution, they should keep it to themselves.
-   Hints can be given if you have a dumb group of players that can't figure out the game
-   The scissors must move clockwise

<h4>Anti-clockwise</h4>

Add an extra layer of complication to the game by being able to pass the scissors anti-clockwise as well as clockwise, utilising two rules. Examples given below...

-   Mouth open or closed
-   Passing using left or right hand
-   Eyes looking at the game master or not
-   None passing hand open or closed as a fist
