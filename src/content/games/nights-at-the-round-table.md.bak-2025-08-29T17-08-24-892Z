### Equipment ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   52 Card Deck
-   1 table
-   Cups
-   Shot glasses
-   Various alcohol types

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Place the deck of cards face-down in the center of a table. Fill the cups and shot glasses with various drinks from beer and cider to cocktails and spirit shots. Once these are filled, space them out evenly around the edge of the table and posiiton each player in front of a drink also evenly spaced. A good rule of thumb is to have at least 2 drinks on the table per player.

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Turn over the cards in the centre to decide which drinks you and other players drink.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Going around the table counter clockwise, the player to the left of the host draws a card first. The instructions for each card follow below:

JACK: Everyone takes a sip from the drink in front of them

QUEEN: Switch with another player's spot and everyone takes a sip from the drink in front of them

KING: Switch two drinks on the table and everyone takes a sip from the drink in front of them

ACE: Take all the drinks and choose who gets to drink what. You can then have people take no sips or multiple sips

JOKER (optional): Everyone gives the person that drew the card their drink. The drawer has to sip ALL drinks given

NUMBER: Move anti-clockwise in front of the next available drink

If a drink is empty, players can choose to remove it or refill it, as the game lasts until all cards have been drawn.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   If a player spills a drink on the table, they must take a shot and refill the drink
-   Before leaving the table, a player must bow to each knight at the table
-   A sip of a cup is equal to 2 fingers
-   A sip of a shot is equal to the entire shot
-   Multiple players cannot be in front of the same drink

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Final Knight at the Round Table**

-   Instead of sipping the drink, each player must finish the drink they are designated
-   Each drink should be replaced when it has been finished
-   JOKER (optional): Add another drink to the table
-   The last player to have drawn a King is no longer a knight and is the King of the table. Throughout their reign they can raise their "sword" once, the last person in the group to do so must take a shot.
-   After the last card is drawn, everyone finishes the drink they are in front of
