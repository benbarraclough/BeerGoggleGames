<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The player holding the ball starts by bouncing the ball to the other player using only one bounce, the player then bounces back with only two bounces.

This continues back and forth until the players reach 7 bounces without messing up.

If a player messes up, they must drink and start again from 1 bounce.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   The only mistake allowed is bouncing the exact amount of times the previous player did (note: this can only be done once per game).
-   Once a player messes up, the game must restart
-   The ball can only be caught when it is bouncing off the table, the ball cannot be caught if it would hit the table again.
-   The ball must be thrown with elbows behind the table.
-   No drinks should be missed.

-   Cups with drinks in (if the ball enters the cup it must be drank)
