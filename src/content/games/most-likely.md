### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Create some funny scenarios to reveal who everyone thinks is the most likely to be in that scenario.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

The first person who can think of a scenario goes first by announcing their question to the whole group.

Example question: "Who is the most likely player to be arrested?"

The player who asked the question must then count down from 3, at which point every participant in the game must vote by pointing at the player that they believe is the most likely.

The player with the most votes must take a sip.

After each question the next person around the circle must then take their turn. If a player cannot think of a question, they can pass but must take a sip.

This game is played until it starts getting sour.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   When a player passes their go multiple times, they must take the same amount of sipsp
-   No questions can be repeated
-   If multiple players have a matching amount of votes, they all drink
-   No delays in voting, everyone must point at the same time and stick with it

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Modify the game slightly by playing:

#### **Most Unlikely**

Instead of asking questions that will reveal who people believe will be the most likely person of a scenario. Replace this or use this along with asking who is the most _unlikely_ person (e.g. Who is the most unlikely player to get married)
