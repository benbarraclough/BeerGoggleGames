### Equipment ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   A drink each
-   A big room

### Setup ![target](/images/settings.webp)

Gather a big group of players in a circle with filled drinks before explaining to everyone the game. Everyone must then decide on a gesture or a move that they will perform on their turn. Going around the circle, everyone must then take it in turns to showcase their gesture to the group so others can remember it (e.g. Double Clap, knee wobble, middle finger)

### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Remember the gestures and don’t mess the chant up when you are jinxed!

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

To begin the game, everybody must chant “tally tally aye, tally tally oh” in sync together whilst slapping thighs on "tally" and clapping hands on "aye" and "oh". The organiser of the game starts by having what is called the jinx and using the 2 steps below this is passed to other players.

1\. The player must start their turn by performing their own gesture on "aye" in place of the clap.

2\. As the same time the next "oh" is chanted by the rest of the group, the same player must perform someone else’s gesture in time with the chant, which passes the jinx to the next player who will repeat the above steps.

This is all done one repetition after another, whereby no "aye" or "oh" is chanted without a person performing a gesture. This creates a chain of gestures between the group that cannot be disrupted.

If a player fails to keep in time with the rhythm, forgets any gestures or performs them at the wrong time, they must drink and start the game from the top.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   A player cannot pass the jinx back to the player who gave it to them
-   Only one player can gesture at a time
-   When not gesturing, you must carry on with the chant
-   When jinxing, the player being given the jinx must be looked at
-   When starting each round, begin gestures after a few chant repetitions have been recited to establish the rhythm

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Complexities**

Use these complex rules if the original game is too easy for everybody

-   Set a different action on "Tally Tally" instead of slapping thighs
-   Everyone passes a cup full of drink round the circle as the game is played
-   Speed up the rhythm of the chant to increase difficulty
