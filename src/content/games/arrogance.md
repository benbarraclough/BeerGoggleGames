### Aim of the Game <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/public/images/target.webp" alt="target" width="40" height="40"></img>

Guess the coin flip correctly to avoid drinking the centre chug cup.

### How to Play <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp" alt="target" width="40" height="40"></img>

Starting with the owner of the coin, they must place as much drink in the centre cup as they wish, call either heads or tails and then flip the coin

If the player guesses correctly, the coin and cup are passed to the next player who repeats the steps above.

If the player guesses incorrectly once, they can choose to either drink whats in the cup OR double down by putting the same amount of drink in again and repeating the steps above.

If the player guesses incorrectly a second time, they must finish the drink and pass it onto the next player to take their turn.

If the cup fills to the top, no further drink can be added which means players do not have the choice to double down. From then on until the chug cup is emptied, players flipping the coin get no second chances, meaning the next time someone guesses a flip incorrectly, the drink must be drank. This is played until everyone is good and drunk.

### Rules ![target](/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp)

-   A minimum of 1 finger of drink is allowed when filling
-   No rigged flipping
-   No late coin calling
-   A player can only double down once
-   To agree when the drink reaches the top of the cup, a vote must be taken

### Special Edition ![target](/BeerGoggleGames/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Quick Fire**

If the drink fills to the top, this starts a quick fire round meaning that each player only gets one chance to guess the coin flip correctly. If not then they must finish it and the game continues on as normal.
