### Overview <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/images/target.webp" alt="" width="32" height="32" />

Arrogance is a fast coin‑flip drinking game. Build the chug cup—or end up drinking it. How confident (arrogant) are you?

### Equipment <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/images/liquor.webp" alt="" width="32" height="32" />

- 1 coin  
- 1 central (chug) cup  
- Each player’s own drink

### Setup <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/images/settings.webp" alt="" width="32" height="32" />

Sit or stand in a circle with the chug cup and coin in the middle.

---

### Aim

Avoid being the player forced to drink the centre chug cup.

### How to Play <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp" alt="" width="32" height="32" />

1. First player pours any amount of their drink into the centre cup, loudly calls “heads” or “tails”, then flips the coin.
2. If the call is CORRECT: pass coin + cup to the next player; they repeat.
3. If the call is WRONG (first miss): that player chooses:  
   a. Drink what’s in the cup (end turn) OR  
   b. “Double Down” – add the SAME amount again and flip a second time (must call again before flip).
4. If the Double Down flip is also WRONG: they must drink the whole cup.
5. After any drink, play continues clockwise with an empty (or partially refilled) cup.
6. If the cup reaches the agreed “full” line: no more liquid may be added—Double Downs are no longer allowed until it’s emptied.

#### Special Situations

- Double Down allowed only once per turn.  
- No late calls (must call before the coin visibly leaves the flipper’s hand).  
- Any dispute = quick majority vote.  
- Reaching “full” converts all turns to sudden death (one guess only).

### Quick Variant <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/images/special.webp" alt="" width="32" height="32" />

> **Quick Fire:** The moment the cup hits “full”, every miss instantly drinks (no Double Down) until someone empties it—then normal play resumes.

### Rules Summary <img class="icon" src="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp" alt="" width="32" height="32" />

- Minimum pour each time: at least a “finger”.
- No rigged or unsafe flips.
- Call must be clear & on time.
- One Double Down max per original attempt.
- “Full” threshold decided by vote at start (or on first argument).
