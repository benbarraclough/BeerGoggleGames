<h4>Circle toss off</h4>

<p>no teams needed, it’s a free for all. Everyone gets in a circle with their own two beer bottles at their feet. With two cups on the go, each player in the group must try and throw the cup onto another’s cup bottle to make them drink. Once both players’ bottles are gone, the player is knocked out. The last player remaining wins and gets to hand their remaining bottle(s) to another player.</p>
