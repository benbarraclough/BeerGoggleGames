Remove the sack/bag of wine from the box and attach it to one of the corners of the washing line using a clothing peg or something similar. Gather players around the rotary clothing line and be ready to play. Add more bags to the clothing line where needed, usually its 1 bag for every 3 people.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Starting with the organiser of the game, they must spin the rotary clothing line with one push and wait until it stops spinning.

If the goon sack of wine stops closest to you, you must take a 3 second drink from the tap.

The drinker then spins the rotary clothing line again, this repeats until a bag is empty which can then be replaced or removed. Once bored or all the bags are finished, the game ends.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   When the clothing line is spun, it cannot be touched until stopped.
-   If the goon sack does not stop in front of any specific player, the closest player to it drinks.
-   If anybody is guilty of unfairness, they must take a drink from the sack.
-   Positions around the clothing line must remain the same.

<h4>Numbered bags</h4>

<p>If you have 9 or more players (3 goon sacks), write numbers on each sack indicating the amount of seconds you must drink of that sack. This speeds up the game and makes it more interesting.</p>
