<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The player with the hammer must throw the hammer up into the air making it do a 360 degree spin, catch it and hit another players nail into the the stump

If a players nail is knocked straight into the stump entirely, they must take 3 sips of their drink and place another nail into the stump for themself.

If a players nail is only slightly knocked into the stump, that player must take only 1 sip of their drink

If a player knocks a nail sideways so that it bends, this nail must be fixed

If a player misses a nail entirely

If sparks fly, everyone must take a sip

If the hammer is dropped, the dropper must take a sip

Each player takes only 1 turn to do this each time they have the hammer. After a players attempt, they must pass to the next player around the circle.

The game continues until somebody gets injured or players have run out of drink/nails.
