<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Take it in turns to call either "Even" or "Odd" before rolling the dice.

If a player guesses both numbers correctly (e.g. Calls Even and the dice show a 2 & 6) then the player gives out 1 sip to another player.

If a player guesses only 1 number correctly, they take 1 sip themselves

If a player guesses both numbers incorrectly, they must take 2 sips and roll again.

After each players turn has ended, they must then pass the dice clockwise for the next player to go.

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   The call must be made before the dice are rolled
-   Dice that land on the floor when rolled still count
-   If a player gets 3 guesses in a row wrong, they must retain the dice until they guess a roll correct.

<GameSection title="**Bonus Rules**" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
-   Split: Take a risk by calling a split - if guessed correctly (one even, one odd), every player except the roller must take a sip. If guessed incorrectly, the roller must drink the amount of sips signified by the dice with the highest number.
-   Sloppy Jalopy: Only rolls that land on the table count, if it lands anywhere else the roller must drink.
-   Double Trouble: If a double is guessed correctly, issue the amount of sips signified by the dice to another player. If guessed incorrectly, the roller takes these sips.
