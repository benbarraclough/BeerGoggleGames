Gather each participant in a circle with a filled drink and burn one end of the cork with the lighter so it goes black. Each player is then given a number starting from 1 going around the circle.

<p>Correctly say the ibble dibble tongue twister when you're called upon.</p>
</GameSection>

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
Person number 1 starts by saying e.g."This is one ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles calling three ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles."

This continues from number 3 in the circle as person number 1 called "ibble-dibble 3". They would say e.g. "This is three ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles calling five ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles."

If a player says the tongue twister correctly, the game moves on to the next person with no change.

If a player says the tongue twister wrong, that person gets a black mark from the cork on their face, must take 2 sips and now have 1 dibble-ibbles to their name. Everytime after that person is called upon, someone will need to say e.g. ... calling five ibble-dibble with one dibble-ibbles.

The game continues adding more dibble ibbles to people's faces until everyone the game comes to a stop.
