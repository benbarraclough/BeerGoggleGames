All participants must gather in a circle and have their own drink to hand. A centre cup must then be filled with a drink of choice for the forfeit and placed in the middle ready to play.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
To begin the game somebody must initiate by saying "I propose a game of 21 to my left/right" Once this is said, the nominated player to begin the game must begin counting using the rules below.

-   Saying one number (e.g. "one") passes the game to the next player in the circle in the initial direction.
-   Saying two numbers (e.g. "one, two") passes to the next player, but reverses direction.
-   Saying three numbers (e.g. "one, two, three") passes in the initial direction, but skips a player.
-   Saying four numbers (e.g. "one, two, three, four") reverses direction and skips a player.

If you say the correct number(s) without messing up, the play moves to the next player nominated based on the numbers the previous person said

If any of the rules are broken whilst counting, you must take a 2 finger sip of your drink

Assuming the round continues with no errors and someone says 21 or their next number is 21, they must perform a forfeit (drinking the centre drink). The next round starts by the loser creating a rule for the next round and initiating the game with the same phrase as how it began.

<GameSection title="**Number Replacements**" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
<p>If the original rules are getting too easy, replace each number or every other number with a word in a certain category of your choice (e.g. alcoholic drinks). This will be harder to remember.</p>
