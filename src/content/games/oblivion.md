### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Finish the race by scoring, drinking, blowing and then flipping your cup before your competitor or be faced with the repercussions of having to play again.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

At the signal of a designated referee or countdown, the players must race to the finish by performing the 4 challenges below:

1.  Prerequisite shots only if required (explained below within the red text)
2.  Bounce the ping pong ball onto the table into your cup
3.  Drink the contents of the cup until empty
4.  Place the cup you just drank from inside the cup which contains the water. Blow into the gap between these cups so that the top cup flies out of the cup with water in and lands into the 3rd cup which should also be empty.
5.  Take the two empty cups and flip both of these separately from right side up to upside down in order to win.

If you are the winner, you're exempt from any further games, unless you choose to play.

If you are the loser, you MUST wear the token and play again if requested by anyone. However, each loss you take has a price of 1 shot each time you play. At the start of each game you must take as many shots as you have obtained in losses before starting the challenges (the amount of losses = the amount of shots).

The loser must then hold the token until they can find a new challenger or a challenger finds them.

This game is essentially never ending and sends the repeating loser into oblivion unless the token is destroyed. The token is only worthy of destruction if a chunder is performed by the player wearing it.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   The ping pong ball can be bounced as close to the cup as the player wishes
-   Both cups need to contains equal amounts of drink
-   A referee must judge the race
-   Chunder must be seen and not just heard
-   The token can be anything as long as it is visible and recognised by everyone
-   Water in the second cup can be modified to the players liking
-   The player with the token cannot deny playing when challenged

-   Cards fate: Each player splits a deck of cards, the number on the card designates the amount of fingers of drink in their first cup. Faces = 10, Ace = 1, etc.
-   Loser Chooses: The loser who wears the token can choose their next competitor by somehow getting the ping pong ball into someones drink
