### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Guess the amount of fives within the group correctly to remove yourself from the game and avoid the forfeit

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

To start, everyone must put their fists in the centre if they want to play. The player who organised the game goes first by counting down from 3. At the end of the count down, each player must either make a fist or an open hand and the player whose go it is must guess the amount of fingers shown (0 or a multiple of 5).

If the player guesses correctly, they are out of the game and do not have to do the forfeit. The next player then takes their turn

If the player guesses incorrectly, they stay in the game and the next player must take their turn

This continues until there are is only 1 player left who is the loser. The loser must then finish their drink

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Each player gets one guess per turn
-   The turn to guess moves clockwise around the circle
-   If a player hesitates when making fist, they must take a sip
-   If a player says a number thats not a 0 or multiple of 5, they must take a sip

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Double Handed**

Each player plays with two hands which means twice as many fives in the game. Each time a player guesses correctly, 1 hand is removed.
