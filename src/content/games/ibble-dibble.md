### Equipment ![target](images/liquor.webp)

-   A drink each
-   A cork

### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Correctly say the ibble dibble tongue twister when you're called upon.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Person number 1 starts by saying e.g."This is one ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles calling three ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles."

This continues from number 3 in the circle as person number 1 called "ibble-dibble 3". They would say e.g. "This is three ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles calling five ibble-dibble with no dibble-ibbles."

If a player says the tongue twister correctly, the game moves on to the next person with no change.

If a player says the tongue twister wrong, that person gets a black mark from the cork on their face, must take 2 sips and now have 1 dibble-ibbles to their name. Everytime after that person is called upon, someone will need to say e.g. ... calling five ibble-dibble with one dibble-ibbles.

The game continues adding more dibble ibbles to people's faces until everyone the game comes to a stop.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Dibble-ibbles need to be well-visible on a persons face.
-   Dibble-ibbles are issued by the person who last called correctly.
-   When calling, you must not stutter, pause, get numbers wrong or say the tongue twister too slowly.
-   You cannot call back the same person who called you.

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Knockout**

After a few too many dibble-ibbles (e.g. 3,5,7), a person is knocked out and must take a shot. The last person surviving wins.
