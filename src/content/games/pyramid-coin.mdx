Place the solo cup in the very middle followed by the double-shot glasses either side, and finally the shot glasses so that there is a sort of pyramid structure in a line. Fill them all up with beer and ensure they are all set 4 fingers apart. The two players participating then sit across from each other holding their coins, aligning themselves with the row of glasses ready to play.

<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/images/question.webp">
The game begins on the count of three where both players attempt to throw their coin into the shot glass.

When a shot is scored, the drink must be drank by the thrower and the throwing continues.

When a shot is missed, the coin should be grabbed again as quickly as possible to take another shot.

When a shot is scored in a glass out of order (bigger than the smallest available) then it must be drank by the shooter and refilled.

The game continues until a player completes the set of three shots and ends the game by scoring in the solo cup. The losing player must then chug the entire solo cup full of beer.
