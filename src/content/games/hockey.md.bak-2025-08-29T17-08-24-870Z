### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

When your name is called, hit other players' cans with the spinnning coin to make them drink

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Starting with the players whos coin it is, the group must take it is turns to spin the coin in the centre of the table and shout another players name. Shouting a name nominates that player as the shooter for that round and they can then hit the coin with one hand whilst it spins in attempt to hit someone elses can(s).

If the shooter hits a players can, the shooter can then perform a punishment spin. where they spin the coin again & the person who conceeded must drink for as long as the coin spins.

**Optional bonus:** If the shooter can stop the coin in an upright position with their finger when performing the punishment spin, the player who conceeded must finish their can completely. However, if failed the shooter must finish their entire can and get a new one.

If a player is nominated to shoot and misses their shot, they must take a sip

After a shot is hit or missed and the forfeits have been completed, the round is over and the next player takes their turn to spin and nominate.

This can be played with lives where each player is assigned 10 lives or without lives where the game is played until everyone falls from their seats.

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   Cans can only be guarded with two fingers and nothing else
-   When a can is finished, this stays on the table and is added to the players stack
-   If a can is hit twice in a row, the conceeding player must wear the helmet of shame (crate box)
-   No disrupting spinning coins unless allowed

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Xtreme Hockey**

-   Revenge: If you finish your can whilst the punishment spin is still going, you can slam your can on it which will make the spinner drink 2 sips.
-   Defense: Starting with 2 fingers of defense, each time you hit a can you gain another finger of defense up to a max of 4. If a player reaches 0 fingers of defense, this only lasts for one round. After which, the player can resets to 2 fingers.
-   Free hit: If a player blocks illegally, the shooter of the original shot gets a free shot on their can(s)
-   Lawless: Whenever a coin is spun, a player can try to stop it upright with their finger in attempt to make the spinner finish their drink. However, if this backfires then the player who dirupts the spin must finish theirs.
