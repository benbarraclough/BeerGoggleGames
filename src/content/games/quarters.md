### Aim of the Game ![target](/images/target.webp)

Get the coin in the drink by bouncing it on the table.

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

Whoever owns the coin has the right to go first. They must bounce the coin on the table in an attempt to get it into the drink. (If you are a pansy and worry about hygeine, fill the cup with water and drink from a separate cup)

If the shot is scored in the centre cup, the scorer chooses a player to chug the drink and refill it for the next round. The losing player then starts the next round.

If the shot misses, nobody drinks and whoever the coin bounces to goes next

The game continues until everyone is too drunk to play

### Rules ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   The coin must bounce on the table at least once for the shot to count
-   The coin cannot be grabbed until is has bounced twice
-   Bounce the coin on its face

### Special Edition ![target](/images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Teams**

Get into teams and place multiple cups on the table. Use the same rules but whichever team scores the least amount of cups must perform a forfeit

**Further alternatives:**-   Change the centre drink to shots
-   Use multiple coins
-   Weak hand throwing
-   Each player who drinks creates a new rule
