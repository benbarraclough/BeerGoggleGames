### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

As the game master, fool other players in the game into thinking that there are rules to the game.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The game master begin by saying "I propose a game of Black Black White to my left". At which point, the person to the left of the game master says must say any combination of the words "Black" and "White".

e.g. "Black, White, White" or "White, Black, Black" etc

If you want that player to be correct, nod for approval and then look at the next player to take their turn.

If you want that player to drink, tell them that their answer was not right and that they must take a sip. The player who answered incorrectly must then start by proposing a game of Black Black White to their left or right.

The game continues until the players realise that the game is a hoax and the game master gets overthrown.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Players must take their turn one by one in the direction proposed
-   No other words other than "Black" and "White" are valid as an answer
-   Players must attempt to go when it is their turn

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by using:

#### **Convincers**

Use the below techniques to fully convince the other players in the game that there are rules for as long as possible.

-   Use another player who will help you convince everyone else by telling others (after a round or two) that they know the secret rule
-   Players will be looking at the game master for signs, confuse them with crossing your legs, saying your answer at a different pace or making strange movements
-   Create fake patterns - If the player before you says "Black Black White" say the opposite "White White Black"
-   Ask what others players have said so that you can "work it out" before you answer
