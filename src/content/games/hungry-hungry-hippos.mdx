<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
After the group counts down from 3 the game starts, each player simultaneously attempts to bounce their ping pong ball into one of the cups in the centre.

When a player scores a cup, they must immediately grab the cup and drink it before they can continue shooting again.

When a player misses, they must retrieve their ball as best as they can to continue shooting

The game ends when all cups in the centre have been claimed and drank. The winner is the player with the most cups and can then issue a forfeit to each loser.
