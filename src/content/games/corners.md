### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Eliminate your opponents lives by hitting the rim or scoring the ball in the opposing teams cups to win.

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Starting when both teams are ready, each team throws the ping pong balls atHaving no physical representation of a player's lifeline, (such as a 6-cup rack in Beer Pong) each player has 4 quarters of a life which they can lose in the two possible ways noted below.

The opposing team scores a shot - costs 2/4 of a life.

The opposing team hits the rim of a cup and then falls to the ground - costs 1/4 of a life.

Once a player loses any amount of their life, they must drink the corresponding amount of alcohol from their drink and then take their turn (providing they have lives remaining).

If a player catches a rebound from the other team hitting their cup, the hit does not count.

Once a player loses their entire life, they are knocked out of the game but can act as their partners rebounder.

This is played until one team eliminates both players from the other team and wins the game.

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   Each player must drink the corresponding amount of alcohol as lives lost before they shoot their shot
-   Winner stays on - Winning team continues playing until they are beaten
-   Shots cannot be interfered or intercepted with until bounced
-   Cups cannot be touched unless to retrieve a pong ball

### Special Edition ![target](images/special.webp)

Add an extra layer of excitement to your game by playing:

#### **Mayhem Style**

-   Play with as many balls as there are available
-   Team of 4 vs 4 on either sides of the table
-   Each player has 4 shots representing 1/4 of a life which are drank instead of (e.g. 1 beer)
-   A bounced shot into a cup costs a player 1 whole or 4/4 quarters of a life (these attempts can be swatted)
