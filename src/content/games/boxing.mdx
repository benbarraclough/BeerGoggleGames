<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
To begin, each player grabs a dice and rolls it at the same time onto the table.

Whichever player rolls the highest number wins that roll and doesn't need to drink.

If both players roll the same number, they tie and roll again.

Whichever player rolls the lowest number loses that roll and must drink a sip of the agreed drink

Play in 3 minute rounds, with 30 second rests between rounds.

Whilst the round is in play, corner men are responsible for delivering the alcohol and motivating their fighter.

Play continues until either player admits defeat, throws up, or has to be excused to use the bathroom. This is a KNOCKOUT!

<GameSection title="Rules" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/rules.webp">
-   If the roll doesn't land on the table, it is void.
-   Opponents must roll at the same time.
-   If a roll is tied, the winner of the second roll drinks double. A second tie would mean a triple drink.
-   Endurance tactics are allowed during rests in between each round (e.g. water, burping, hot towel).
-   The referee is in charge of timekeeping and keeping the players rolling.
