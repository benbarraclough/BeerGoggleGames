### Aim of the Game ![target](images/target.webp)

Guess your rolls correctly or bluff convincingly enough to not drink

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

The game begins by a taking it in turns to shake the two dice in the cup and slap it top-down on the table trapping the dice.

Without letting anybody else see, the player takes a peak at what they've rolled and announces their score. Rather than adding the numbers on the dice together to get a score, the numbers are combined with the highest number coming first (e.g. 2 and a 4 makes 42).

The dice are then passed to the next person to roll and announce. The aim is for each roll to be higher than the previous person's roll.

If the roll is higher than the previous person's, the dice are announced and passed to the next player.

If the roll is lower, the player can bluff or take 2 sips of their drink.

Once a player has announced, any other player in the group can call their bluff until the next person grabs the cup.

If someones bluff gets called or if someone calls someones bluff incorrectly, that player must down their drink.

This continues until the flow breaks and someone drinks. Then the game starts from the beginning

### Rules ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   A 2 and a 1 makes a Mexicali and beats all other rolls.
-   Once the next person touches the cup, nobody can call the previous roller's bluff
