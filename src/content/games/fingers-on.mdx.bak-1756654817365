<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
To start, everyone who is playing must place one finger on the centre drink. Starting with the youngest, each round one person must guess how many fingers will be left on the drink after the count down of “3,2,1”. Initiated by the current guesser, at the end of each countdown each person decides to either take their finger off or keep it on the drink whilst the guesser shouts out a number.

If the guesser guesses correctly, they’re out of the game and the round continues with the next person initiating the countdown.

If the guesser guesses incorrectly, they stay in the game and the round continues with the next person initiating the countdown.

This continues until one last person is left on the drink, which then means that they are the loser and must drink the centre drink.

<GameSection title="**No Celebrations**" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
Whenever a player guesses correctly and is removed from the game, they must remain composed and refrain from celebrating until the next person begins to count down.

**Additional alternatives:**-   Replace the centre drink with shot or punishment
-   Centre drink is topped up each time somebody celebrates
-   Multiple fingers per person for game longevity
-   Guess how many fists or open hands if you can't play normal version
