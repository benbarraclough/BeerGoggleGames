<GameSection title="How to Play" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
The game starts as soon as both team mates say ready to eachother. The player with the can must throw it to the other player who must try to catch it.

If the can is caught, the catcher must take 1 full stride backwards and then throw it back to their team mate. This continues until the can is dropped or until each player has thrown 3 times.

If the can is dropped, the game ends and the team must open and share the can.

If there is only one pair playing, the player who makes the mistake must drink. If there are multiple teams, each team takes their turn and the ultimate loser is the team who catches the least amount of throws.

<GameSection title="**King Catcher**" icon="/BeerGoggleGames/images/question.webp">
<p>Using the ‘winner stays on’ game format, each player must compete in a free for all match to be the king catcher by simply not messing up. The game is the same, although a third party is employed to be the referee for each match. Taking a maximum of 5 steps, the players must throw and catch until 1 player messes up. The loser is decided by the ref and they must finish the can, the referee then chooses the contender and ref for the next game (ref can remain the same if desired).</p>
