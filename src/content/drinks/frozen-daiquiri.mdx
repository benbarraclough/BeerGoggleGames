3.  Ice - 100g
4.  Lime - 15ml

2.  Blend again the fruit puree with the ice, the rum, lime and sugar syrup.
3.  Pour the contents into a glass, garnish with a few pieces of fruit and add a straw.

### Top Tips ![target](/images/lightbulb.webp)

-   You can use frozen fruit to give your drinks a thicker texture.
-   Don't blend for too long, or else your misture will become too watery.
-   Blending your mixture with crushed ice is better than big chunks.
