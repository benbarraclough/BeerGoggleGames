1.  Vodka - 50ml
2.  Coffee Liqueur - 25ml

1.  Add ice to a rocks glass along with a shot of vodka and half a shot of coffee liqueur.
2.  Mix these together with a stirer or give it a quick swirl.
3.  Slowly pour the cream in and you're ready to serve.

### Top Tips ![target](/images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Milk can be used in place of cream, however a heavy cream will give a richer taste.
-   Slowly pour the cream in using a spoon to delicately layer the liquid on top of what is already in the glass to create a colour gradient.
