### Ingredients ![target](/images/liquor.webp)

-   Red wine - 150ml
-   Brandy - 20ml
-   Orange juice - 40ml
-   Orange bitters - 3 dashes
-   Brown sugar - 1 Tsp

-   Orange - Half
-   Ice - 1 handful

### Recipe ![target](/images/rules.webp)

1.  Chop fruit into slices and add to a shaker with the brown sugar.
2.  Muddle the fruit and sugar so that the fruit juice combines with the sugar.
3.  Add orange bitters and brandy then muddle again lightly.
4.  Put a handful of ice in your glass then pour in the muddled mixture
5.  Add the wine and orange juice and then mix

### Top Tips ![target](/images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Use a light red wine (preferably spanish) as some full bodied wines can be too strong in flavour.
-   Garnish with slices of apple and orange after making the drink as the fruit muddled is usually not very presentable.
-   If you don't have the specific ingtredients listed, you can make it with simialr ingredients (e.g. you can use bourbon or cognac instead of brandy).
