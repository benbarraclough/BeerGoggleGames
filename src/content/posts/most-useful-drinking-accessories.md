#### Beer Bong

An undeniable favourite for consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short amount of time.

This drinking apparatus utilises three vital components, the funnel, the pipe and the valve to hold =, deliver and control the consumption.

A beer bong can be utilised in many circumstances for forfeits, races and getting those who haven't drank as much caught up with everyone else. There are lots of possibilities for a beer bong, some of which we have outlined in our [glossary](extras/glossary). Find yourself a reliable piece of equipment that is at least a 2 feet long so that it can be used for maximum enjoyment.

#### Breathalyser

Struggle to know when enough is enough? Get a pocket size breathalyser to settle your worries.

The cheap and cheerful version that I have linked below should not be used to dictate whether it is okay for you to drive after a drink or few, as its likely inaccurate.

This can be used as a bit of fun during a night of drinking, testing who the lightweight is or who is the winner of being most drunk.

#### Cap Shooter

A brilliant way to maintain a tidy pad and keep the drinks flowing in at the same time.

The cap shooter doesn't only shoot caps but it opens the bottle for you and loads it in the chamber to be shot wherever you may please.

Use the gun as a part of a game by necking drinks and shooting targets or holster it yourself to issue punishments to unruley guests, your choice.

#### Spirit Pistol

![](images/spiritpistol.webp)  
  

A playful way to get shots down people during a party.

Fill the gun up with your favourite spirit and give it a squirt. Using a pistol will require quite a few squirts for you to feel it so be prepared to refill quite often if its a small shoota.

Use this as a punishment during games or pass a few round for a bit of fun during a night of drinking

#### Shotgun Tool

![](images/shotguntool.webp)  
  

The tool for all the pro drinkers out there who love to shotgun a beer, learn more about shotguns in the [glossary](extras/glossary).

One of the best ways to drain a can is a good shotgun, but the main problem for most is getting that damn hole in the can without destroying it completely or shaking the beer up so much that its all foamy.

A tool has been devised to make this as easy as using a bottle opener, just press, pierce and chug. Anybody who is anybody in the drinking world has one of these in their aresenal so they can make sure a shotgun is always on the cards.
