A collection of party themes that will help inspire ideas for your next party, with tips on how to do it right.

A good theme can be an exciting way to up your party game, giving a venue an interesting atmosphere changes it into something a bit different that a regular party. Themes give people a chance to dress up and act a little differently by separating them from the real world.

Themed parties usually get a good response and turn-out because of the added element of fun that it involves, but this depends on how you handle the set up.

In this blog post, what will also be featured for each theme is how to execute them and make them into a big motive rather than just a lame attempt that will end up lookng like a kids birthday party.

#### 1\. Neon Rave

At number one we have the best theme by far, it offers everything and nothing at the same time, allowing expectations to go wild and freedom to make the party about whatever you like.

Use glow in the dark items and neon paint to create whatever party you desire, from the Psychadelic Festival vibe to Alien Sci-fi. Use blacklights in each room of the venue and paint on the walls to create the atmosphere you want, this can get messy so make sure that the paint can be easily removed. The more glow in the dark features there are, the cooler the place will look, so get creative or find an artist in to make the place pop.

Take a look at the following list for ideas on how to build your party theme:

-   Neon paint
-   Blacklights
-   Glow in the dark toys
-   Glow sticks
-   Glow in the dark clothing
-   Glow in the dark pens
-   Rave music

#### 2\. Disco Dudes & Go-Go Gals

You can't beat this theme for its ability to get girls interested, and with that comes the guys too, which makes this our second favourite theme

With this theme, you need to be willing to play some disco music to give the party its full effect, because disco is all about the music and the dancing. If you know a DJ with CDJ's, vinyl or even a controller, get them involved to play some funky music and get the people dancing. This can be restrictve, but if multiple rooms are available, a variation of music can be played to please everyone.

Take a look at the following list for ideas on how to build your party theme:

-   Glitter everywhere
-   Disco Ball
-   Colourful lights
-   A punch bowl with ladel
-   Bathtub of colourful ballpt balls
-   Balloons & anything sparkly
-   Checkered dance floor
-   Dangling chrome decor & fake vinyl records
-   Pictures of vinyl records on the wall
-   Lasers/Strobes
-   A vocal DJ hosting dance competitions
-   Hippie quotes

#### 3\. Toga

An ultimate party theme that gets everyone unified in the sacred toga costume. Make way for games, brotherly love and probably a bit of nudity at some point.

The theme usually consists of the colours white and gold as well as purple alongside some greenery. Purple represented royalty and wealth back in the ancient times, so this colour should be used sparingly. Knowing how to tie a toga is rule number one, so follow this [link](https://youtu.be/_4hWqIW--rQ) to learn. Otherwise, ensure that there are lots of "toga" chanting, team games and of course drinking.

Take a look at the following list for ideas on how to build your party theme:

-   Award laurel wreath crowns as a reward of triumph for people winning games
-   Greco-Roman invitations
-   Roman pillars
-   Fake ivy
-   Lots of white sheets
-   Thrones
-   Grapes for snacks
-   Chariot race piggy back
-   Tug of war
-   Oiled up wrestling
-   Toga costume
-   Chalices

#### 4\. Jungle Jamboree

The jungle theme usually means one thing, guests must either dress up or paint themselves to look like animals from the jungle. From here the decorations is where the focus should be, tissue paper, plants, inflatables, everything you can to make it feel like a full on forest.

Take a look at the following list for ideas on how to build your party theme:

This classy affair focuses on the social aspect of the evening and the up-market ambience. The pace can be a lot slower to begin with but can turn into whatever you want after the heavy alcohol percentage of the cocktails kick in.
