#### 1\. Psych

Possibly one of the best party apps out there! Psych gets everyone involved by creating a joinable lobby for all participants.

Choose from a variety of fun categories in which each player makes up fake answers to real trivia questions. The aim is to choose the outrageous real answer among your friends’ fakes? Get points for guessing the right answer, and for each other player you PSYCH! into choosing yours.

This reaches the top of our list for many reasons but mainly due to the amount of time you can spend having fun with this and its replayability. Each game is different depending on who you're playing with and how drunk you are as this relies on imagination and creativity. The only negative aspect of this game is that it is entirely device based, so you miss out on interacting with eachother in person. For some may not be a bad thing, especially if you have players who can't be physically together and can only communicate digitally.

#### 2\. Charades

A close second place is the app that everyone knows the rules for and does not fail to entertain.

Similar to the original game but with different challenges from dancing, singing, acting or sketching -- guess the word on the card that’s on your head from your friends’ clues before the timer runs out! The app has a large variety of themes which loads of words for each that can be used ironically, literally or euphemistically for some fun.

One of the best things about the app is that it can be played by a group of any size, whether that be a room full of drunks or just a few friends. No skill requirements or prior knowledge is required, as the simple rules can be picked up pretty damn quickly.

#### 3\. iPuke

A largely underappreciated game which can be played with a small or large group by placing the device in the middle to act as the game board.

On every turn you'll draw a card with 2 options: a crazy dare and an amount of shots to drink. You must complete at least one to proceed, and they're both worth some points. The first brave player to reach the points goal wins the game! There are over 260 cards available, so you'll never get bored!

This app comes in at third place as it offers a good variety of unique dares that usually gets the party going. The only con is that the scoring system is slightly broken as the points will remain the same whether you take a drink or do the dare. However, your turn could be skipped as an alternative.

#### 4\. Picolo

![](images/picolo.webp)  
  

An app that is raved about and unarguably highly developed and fun to play. Use the questions, prompts and dares given to you to compete against eachother in a alcohol-fuelled game of ability.

In teams or individually, answer the questions and follow the rules. The app takes care of everything and is great for when you can't be bothered the prep of a 'manual' drinking game.

The Picolo app is free to download but comes only with the basic level. You will have to pay for the other rounds which you might eventually do as the game gets interesting and the alcohol starts to hit you. The only con of this game is that there is no creative freedom and you just follow the orders that the device gives you which some may find restrictive.

#### 5\. Dirty Potato

Lastly is the alternative game of the year in our books, a simple yet exciting game that is played best in groups and creates a thrilling sense of urgency & anxiety for all.

The game originates from the classic Hot Potato idea, combine this with some random, filthy and outrageous questions along with a few embarrassing challenges and abracadabra, you've got Dirty Potato! A fast paced game that is a quick and easy game to get a party going.

After playing this a few times, it was a pretty good way to get everyone lively and talkative but quickly loses its charm after a few turns. Definitely worth a download and a game or two every now and again, so give it a try.
