The essential list for house party planning. Use our tips as your basic must-haves and get creative with the rest.

If you're someone who struggles to remember all the important aspects of a house party and need a helping hand or you're just looking for bonus tips and advice, then you're in the right place.

A good house party has 5 main ingredients which will be listed below with examples and how they can be achieved.

On top of this, we've included BeerGoggleGames bonus ideas which we believe are key to party success.

#### Quote of the day:

> We wanna be free, we wanna be free to do what we wanna do. And we wanna get loaded. And we wanna have a good time. And that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna have a good time. We're gonna have a party.

#### 1\. Music

The first and most essential in our list is music, which can be done in many different ways but should basically be the main vibe behind the party.

To create different vibes, you can look at having either a regular playlist, a DJ, live music, multiple playlists, linked multi-room speakers, and more.

You can then use the genre of music and the volume to create the atmosphere you need, the quieter it is, the more sociable it will be and the louder it is, the more club-like it will be.

#### 2\. Drink

Next is the almighty alcohol, this is the driving force behind most parties which allows everyone to let loose and have some fun without too much thought ruining things.

Beer, wine, spirits, whatever you're tweaking on, make sure you and everyone else has enough of it, because the worst thing is going dry when you don't want to. In our opinion, the more the better, but if you know how to party off the drink drink then thats not a problem.

Getting a variation of alcohol can take your party to the next level, from doing shots to sipping cocktails out of a punch bowl, or even having a classy bit of wine. This allows people to switch gears and gives them a chance to switch up or tone down without the party going dead.

#### 3\. Space & Seating

The area that you use is vital to any party, there needs to be the right amount of space for people to chat, move, dance, rest, drink, smoke and PLAY GAMES.

Be sure that you make room for all of the above by supplying seating suitable for each activity (e.g. Enough chairs in a big communal area so that everyone can interact or play games in one place if needed). This means sofas, bean bags, chairs, benches and even mattresses scattered around in their designated rooms.

If you do all of these things correctly, people will feel comfortable in all areas of the party.

#### 4\. Lighting & Decor

A major part of any party is how the atmosphere feels which is very much a visual thing. The visuals at a party are one of the best things you can focus on to make sure that the atmosphere isn't shit.

Lighting: Depending on the amount of rooms you have this can be done differently, but you should try to make three very distinct areas:

1.  Party - Mood lighting, strobe or coloured lights (not bright)
2.  Chill - A dark place that is relaxing but light enough that people can see of course
3.  Reality - A light place that is away from the party that can be used for practicalities (usually the kitchen)

The above can be done with dimmed ceiling lights, lamps, coloured bulbs, blacklights, strobe lights, disco lights and more. You can even get creative using coloured cellophane over lighting you already own (be warned: done wrong, this is a fire hazard).

Decor: This also contributes to the atmosphere by transforming the rooms you see on the regular into full on party central. Add decorations & party accessories to the surroundings such as balloons, paint, wall hangings, rave glasses, beer bong, etc. but also removing the stuff that doesn't scream party, the success is in simplicity.

If you know how to do interior design, fashion or just generally good at knowing what is visually pleasing then this might be something you're good at. If not, you may need a hand because you'll probably fuck it up.

#### 5\. People

Last but by no means least, you can't have a party without the people, or else its just sad and lonely.

The first thing that is needed here is to work out how many people you can invite which requires you to consider the amount of people that you have to invite and the capacity of the space you're partying in.

Simply put, the bigger the better (depending on the occasion of course). If a specific number isn't required then its always best to invite the most people possible. When inviting, send the offers out to groups or make sure they know that other friends of theres are coming, this is so that people don't feel like they would be alone.

If you're sure that the party is happening, don't be quiet about, be confident and give insights on what will be happening, as this will stop anyone from being hesitant about whether they're coming or not. If its not obvious to the people you invite that the party will be a motive, you've either invited the wrong people or not sold it enough.

The last thing to remember is that you should always invite at least 20% more people than what the capacity is, as this will acccount for drop outs.
