Have a browse through our list of outdoor games which are perfect for those hot summer days when you don't want to be indoors.

We have a great collection of active sports games as well as chilled ones that let you bask in the sun. You may need some equipment but these games can be taken anywhere, whether thats the beach, the park or just the garden.

The active nature of outdoor games burns off more calories than regular card games which gives you all the more reason to not take it easy on those tasty cans.

#### Floating Drinks Cooler

For those of you lucky to have a pool at your disposal, floating drink coolers are a great way to keep the drinks flowing whilst having fun in the pool.

A specialty product can be bought or you can re-engineer your regular cooler into a floating variant by attaching pool noodles to it using cable ties. Either put the ice into the floating cooler to keep your cans/bottles cool or make it into a floating punch bowl, just be careful it doesn't get knocked into the water.

You don't have to stop here with your party floaties, there is also floating beer pong tables and floating ring toss available.

#### Beer Run

A more creative activity where you build a maze for your drinks, similar to a marble run but it takes alcohol instead and transports it down a series of channels towards an end point where someone would drink.

This creative way of drinking is perfect for outdoor drinking in the sun as the run can be made out of anything (foil, hotwheels track, pipe, etc.) from anywhere (out the kitchen window, up a tree, down the garden, etc.) with no worries of mess.

An alternative if you don't have the equipment is a beer delivery system that uses a slide of some sort to transport a can of beer from one place to another.

No matter how convenient something is, nothing can beat the convenience of drinking a beer with no hands.

Using the latest 21st century technology, wearable devices are here and in lots of different shapes & sizes. Both beer helmets and chest pouches can offer you the freedom of movement wherever you are on your day of summer fun.

#### Lucky dip

![](/images/luckydip.webp)  
  

Create a bit of excitment by making a lucky dip and placing a variation of drinks inside that people can pick at random.

Use a box or bag and then try to add a real mixture of drinks to make it as random as possible. You could either use sealed containers of drinks that are pre-made or something you have created and bottled yourself.

If you want the lucky dip to be a bit of a mystery and you know that there will likely be some cheats putting back what they don't want, use paper. Write on the paper different types of drinks so that there is no way the lucky dipper can choose a preference.
