Power hours are the couch potato's bread and butter. The aim of the game is to enjoy the entertainment shown on screen and drink when necessary. This is a brilliant way to get a group of friends to drink socially together without focusing too much on the game itself, and instead just enjoying the entertainment as a group whlst getting pissed.

We've included some of the best videos for enjoyment, interaction and comedy purposes tailored to a wide set of audiences.

Hook this up to the TV, get some buddies together with a case of beers and pick your favourite to play.
