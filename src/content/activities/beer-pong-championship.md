The regular game of [beerpong](GameCategories/PongGames/beerpong) should then be played by the first two teams. The win is then recorded on the table and the losing team is knocked out, the winner proceeds to the next round closer to the finale.

This proceeds until only 2 teams are left who will then play each other for the championship prize.

### Top Tips ![target](images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Find a trophy or a plaque to give as the championship prize.
-   If there are a lot of teams, have multiple tables set up.
-   Use a group stage points table if you want to elongate the competition.
