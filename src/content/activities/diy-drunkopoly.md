### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

To begin, make a rough plan of how you want your boardgame to look like (sketch, features, rules, objectives).

In your game, you can involve drinking tasks such as a shot or 2 sips as well as other dares, forfeits and challenges.

Examples:

1.  Use a start and finish format with simple blocks that have tasks on such as shots, dares or truths.
2.  Make a circuit, similar to monopoly whereby you earn rewards when you pass 'GO' and pick up cards with tasks.
3.  Build a level based boardgame, this requires the players to progress through each level of the game by completing tasks to get to the finish.

Cut your game board out of the cardboard and cover the top in paper. Draw the game and colour it to make it pop before taping over the top of it with clear tape so it doesn't smudge or get damaged.

Ensure that the accessories needed for the game are available (dice, counters, pen, paper) and then give it a go.

### Top Tips ![target](images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Make your rules dynamic and varied so that the game can be multiple times without being boring.
-   Ensure the game is complete before taping over it.
-   Create shortcuts in your boardgame paths.
-   Search online and in other boardgames for ideas to include.
