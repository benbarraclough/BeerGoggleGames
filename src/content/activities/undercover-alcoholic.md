### Requirements ![target](/images/rules.webp)

-   Any alcohol
-   A group of sober unwise individuals

### How to Play ![target](/images/question.webp)

This game can be played with any amount of players but the smaller amount of people within a group the better. However, it is not encouraged to be played alone, as that is called being an alcoholic and we do not support that.

Find a partner or two to get involved in the deception of the wider group and make an agreement of the choice of alcohol e.g. beer, spririt, wine. From here you can either decide to team up and see how far you can both go without getting found out or go up against each other to see who gets caught first and who gets the most drink down them.

Once someone is found out, the other can either confess or continue until they get found out themselves.

### Top Tips ![target](/images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Find a safe place where the alcohol can be stored or hidden so you don't have to drink it nearby the others.
-   Use breath mints so that alcohol can't be smelt on your breath.
-   Have a water on the side used for either a decoy or is actually filled with a bit of vodka too.
-   This is a dangerous game to be good at, so be careful how you play.
