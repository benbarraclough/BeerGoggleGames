### Requirements ![target](images/rules.webp)

-   2 pushers
-   2 jousters
-   2 office chairs with wheels
-   A long floor space
-   Lances (optional)

### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Each jouster begins by choosing their 'horse' which is an office chair with wheels, typically the chair with the most stablility and protection is best. From here the jouster must then find a pusher who will be on their team to motivate and push them to victory.

The jousters must then choose whether they want to wield a lance which is a long staff made out of items such as toilet roll tubes or beer cans stuck together with tape. Each jouster must then mount their horse with their lance and any protection that they wish (e.g. helmet, cardboard armour, etc.).

The pushers should then get their jousters into position at opposite ends of the space you're jousting in. On the count of 3, both pushers must then push their jousters towards one another in hopes that their jouster will remain on their horse and claim victory.

The same process continues until a player is crowned the winner.

### Top Tips ![target](images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Keep duct tape on hand for in-game repairs
-   Turn this into a tournament by playing winner stays on
-   Try to joust on a smooth flooring and not carpet, so that speed can be maximised
