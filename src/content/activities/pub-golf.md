### How to Play ![target](images/question.webp)

Gather a group of players that are prepared for a night of heavy drinking and plan a route through your nearby local area, hitting 9 or more pubs/bars if possible. This plan should then be written down onto a scorecard along with each player

The game starts once everyone is dressed into their golf outfits and make it to the first place on the pub/bar list.

Each player takes it in turns to choose the drink of choice for the group, once chosen all players must order their drink and take it in turns to have sips. These sips are equivalent to golf shots and should be recorded then logged on the score card when drinks have been finished. For example, a chugged beer counts as a hole in one.

Once drinks have been consumed, the group must travel to the next hole to have their next drink. This continues until the end of the night when all holes have been completed or when there are no players remaining

Scores are kept up to date by the golf captain, if a player cannot complete a hole a standard sip count of 5 is given.

### Top Tips ![target](images/lightbulb.webp)

-   Top off your outfits with visors and inflatable golf clubs.
-   If a player throws up, a +2 will be added to the score sheet.
-   A water between each hole is advised.
