### Top Tips ![target](images/lightbulb.webp)

-   A maraschino cherry is the preferred type to use for this drink.
-   The grenadine can be poured in last for the waterfall effect, as it still rests on the bottom due to its higher density.
-   If the drink is not entirely full, just fill further with orange juice.
