### Top Tip ![target](images/lightbulb.webp)

-   If you don't have a blender at hand, crush the ice manually somehow and mix everything together using a cocktail shaker.
-   Coconut cream and cream of coconut are used to make the best piña coladas, however coconut milk can be used as well. Coconut milk is a little less rich in flavour and unsweetened, keep this in mind.
