    <!-- Intro / Mission -->
    <p>
      Welcome to BeerGoggleGames, a non-profit site providing a full library of games, recipes, party activities, and more. Our goal is to build a complete collection of party information, making social gatherings more fun. You’ll find blog posts, a glossary, forfeits, tools, and curated variations to keep things fresh whether you’re at a small get-together or a bigger event.
    </p>

    <p>
      The collection keeps growing. Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are always welcome. Reach out if you spot something missing or want to share something of your own.

      Know your limits, stay hydrated, look after your friends, and adapt games where possible so everyone can take part.
